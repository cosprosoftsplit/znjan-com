## How Far Is Žnjan Beach from Split Centre?

Žnjan Beach is approximately **4 kilometres east** of Diocletian's Palace (Split Old Town). Depending on your transport, it takes anywhere from 10 minutes by taxi to about an hour on foot.

| Transport | Time | Cost | Best For |
|-----------|------|------|----------|
| **Bus** | 15 min | ~€2 | Budget travellers |
| **Taxi/Uber** | 10 min | €6–9 | Convenience, groups |
| **Car** | 10–15 min | Parking fees | Families with gear |
| **Bicycle** | 15–20 min | Free or €8–12 rental | Active visitors |
| **Walking** | 45–60 min | Free | Scenic route lovers |

## By Bus (Cheapest Option)

Take **bus line 8 or line 15** from the city centre. Both lines run regularly throughout the day, roughly every 15–20 minutes in summer.

**Where to catch it:** The most convenient stop is near the Green Market (Pazar) or along Domovinskog rata street near the port.

**Where to get off:** Exit at the **Žnjan** stop — you'll see the beach promenade immediately on your right.

**Cost:** A single ticket costs approximately €2. Buy from the driver or at a Tisak newsstand for a small discount.

**Tip:** The bus can get crowded during peak summer hours (10am–1pm). If you're carrying beach gear, consider going slightly earlier or later.

## By Taxi or Uber

The fastest and most comfortable option, especially if you're travelling with kids or lots of beach equipment.

**Cost:** €6–9 from Diocletian's Palace, depending on traffic and time of day.

**Apps available:** Both **Uber** and **Bolt** operate in Split. Download them before your trip — they're generally cheaper than street taxis.

**Tip:** Getting a taxi back can be harder during peak evening hours when everyone leaves the beach. Have Uber/Bolt ready on your phone, or walk to the main road where taxis pass more frequently.

## By Car

If you're driving in Split or renting a car, Žnjan is an easy 10–15 minute drive from the centre.

**Route:** Follow the coastal road **Šetalište Pape Ivana Pavla II** east from the city. You'll pass through the Bačvice and Trstenik areas before reaching Žnjan.

**Parking:** The new **underground garage has 530 spaces** plus **451 outdoor spots**. The underground garage is covered, keeping your car cool in summer heat.

**Peak times:** The garage fills up on summer weekends by 10–11am. On weekdays, you'll usually find a spot until early afternoon.

See our dedicated [parking guide](/en/articles/znjan-beach-parking-guide/) for pricing details and tips.

## By Bicycle

Split has been expanding its cycling infrastructure, and the coastal route to Žnjan is one of the best rides in the city.

**Route:** Follow the seafront promenade east from Bačvice. The path is flat and mostly paved — an easy ride even for casual cyclists. You'll pass Ovčice, Trstenik, and Firule beaches before arriving at Žnjan.

**Distance:** About 4 km from the Old Town, taking 15–20 minutes at a relaxed pace.

**Bike rental:** Several shops near the harbour rent bikes for approximately **€8–12 per day**. Some hotels also offer complimentary bikes.

**Parking your bike:** There are bike racks along the Žnjan promenade. Lock your bike securely.

## On Foot (The Scenic Route)

Walking to Žnjan from Split centre takes about **45–60 minutes**, but it's one of the most pleasant walks in the city. The entire route follows the waterfront, passing through several beach areas.

**Route:** Start at the Riva (Split's main promenade), head east past Bačvice Beach, continue through Ovčice, Firule, and Trstenik. The path is flat and paved the entire way.

**What you'll see:** The walk gives you a taste of Split's entire eastern coastline — different beaches, local cafes, fishing boats, and views across to the islands.

**Tip:** Start early in the morning to avoid the midday heat, especially in July and August. Bring water.

## Getting Back to the City

All the same options work in reverse. A few additional tips:

- **Bus stop location:** The return bus stop is on the main road above the beach, not on the beach itself. It's about a 3-minute walk from the promenade.
- **Evening taxis:** Demand spikes around 7–8pm when families head home. Book via app rather than trying to flag one down.
- **Sunset walk:** If the weather is pleasant, walking back along the promenade at sunset is highly recommended. You'll arrive in the centre just in time for dinner.

## Quick Tips

1. **Download Uber/Bolt** before arriving in Split — they save you money and hassle over street taxis
2. **Buy a bus card** if you plan to use public transport multiple times
3. **Bring a small backpack** rather than beach bags if you're taking the bus — easier to manage in crowds
4. **Don't drive on peak summer weekends** unless you arrive before 10am — parking fills up quickly
5. **The walk back is easier** than the walk there — it's flat, and you're refreshed from the beach
