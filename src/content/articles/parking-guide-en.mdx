## Parking Overview

The €45.5 million Žnjan renovation included a major upgrade to parking infrastructure. Gone are the chaotic dirt lots — the beach now has organised, modern parking with nearly **1,000 total spaces**.

| Parking Type | Spaces | Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Underground garage** | 530 | Covered concrete | Coolest option in summer |
| **Outdoor lots** | 451 | Paved | Closer to some beach sections |
| **Disabled parking** | 10 (reserved) | Connected to beach via access path | Within underground garage |
| **Total** | **~990** | | |

## Underground Garage

The new underground garage is the centrepiece of the parking upgrade:

- **530 spaces** on multiple levels
- **Covered and cool** — your car won't be an oven when you return
- **Well-lit and secure** with CCTV
- **Direct pedestrian access** to the promenade via stairs and elevator
- **10 spaces reserved** for disabled drivers, connected to the beach by an accessible path

## Outdoor Lots

The 451 outdoor spaces are distributed along the length of the beach. Some sections are closer to specific beach areas than the garage, making them convenient if you know which part of the beach you're heading to.

## When Does Parking Fill Up?

| Day | Fills by | Advice |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **Weekday (June)** | Usually doesn't fill | No rush needed |
| **Weekend (June)** | ~11am | Arrive by 10am |
| **Weekday (Jul–Aug)** | ~11am–noon | Arrive by 10am |
| **Weekend (Jul–Aug)** | ~9:30–10am | Arrive by 9am or take the bus |
| **September** | Usually doesn't fill | Relaxed timing |

**Peak pressure hours:** 10am–2pm on summer weekends. If you arrive during this window, expect to wait or circle.

## Alternatives When Parking Is Full

If the Žnjan lots are full, don't panic:

1. **Take the bus** — Lines 8 and 15 run from the centre every 15–20 minutes. Park your car at your accommodation and bus in.
2. **Park at a nearby street** — Residential streets in the Žnjan neighbourhood sometimes have available spots, though these fill up too in peak season.
3. **Come early or late** — Arrive before 9am for guaranteed parking, or after 4pm when early-comers start leaving.
4. **Use a taxi/Uber** — Drop-off is free and easy at the promenade entrance. Have Uber/Bolt ready for the return trip.

## Tips for a Stress-Free Parking Experience

1. **Weekdays are dramatically easier** than weekends — if your schedule is flexible, go midweek
2. **The underground garage** stays cooler and protects your car from the sun — worth it in July/August
3. **Don't forget where you parked** — the garage is large. Take a photo of your level/section number
4. **Motorbikes and scooters** have dedicated areas near the garage entrance
5. **Electric vehicle charging** — check locally for availability, as EV infrastructure in Split is expanding
