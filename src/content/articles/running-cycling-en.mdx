## The Žnjan Promenade

The redesigned **2+ kilometre Žnjan promenade** is one of Split's best assets for runners and cyclists. Built as part of the €45.5M renovation, it features separate lanes for pedestrians and cyclists, quality paving, lighting for evening use, and stunning coastal views.

## Route Options

### Short Loop: Žnjan Promenade (2 km)
- **Distance:** ~2 km one way (4 km out-and-back)
- **Surface:** Flat, paved
- **Best for:** Easy morning runs, family cycling, sunset walks
- **Description:** The promenade stretches the full length of Žnjan Beach, lined with pavilion restaurants, benches, and landscaped greenery. Completely flat with sea views the entire way.

### Medium Route: Bačvice to Žnjan (4 km)
- **Distance:** ~4 km one way (8 km out-and-back)
- **Surface:** Paved, mostly flat
- **Best for:** Moderate runs, scenic cycling
- **Description:** Start at Bačvice Beach and follow the coastal path east through Ovčice, Firule, and Trstenik before reaching Žnjan. The route passes through several neighbourhood beaches — each with its own character.

### Long Route: Split Marina to Žnjan (7 km)
- **Distance:** ~7 km one way (14 km out-and-back)
- **Surface:** Paved, flat
- **Best for:** Distance runners, extended bike rides
- **Description:** Start at the Split harbour/marina area and follow the waterfront all the way to the eastern end of Žnjan. This covers nearly the entire south coast of Split's peninsula.

## Best Times for Running

| Time | Conditions | Crowd Level |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **6–8am** | Cool, sunrise light | Very quiet |
| **8–10am** | Warm, pleasant | Light |
| **5–7pm** | Cooling down, sunset | Moderate |
| **7–9pm** | Cool, illuminated promenade | Light |

**Avoid:** 11am–4pm in summer — the heat is intense (29–31°C) and the promenade has limited shade.

**Best season:** April–June and September–October offer ideal running temperatures (18–25°C) without summer crowds.

## Cycling Information

### Bike Rental
Several shops near Split's harbour and in the Žnjan area rent bikes:
- **Daily rental:** €8–12 for a city/hybrid bike
- **Half-day:** €5–8
- **Some hotels** offer complimentary bikes to guests

### Rules & Etiquette
- Use the **cycling lane** where marked — the Žnjan promenade has dedicated bike sections
- **Yield to pedestrians** on shared paths, especially children
- **Cycling speed:** Keep it moderate (15–20 km/h) on the promenade — it's not a racing track
- **Lock your bike** at the racks along the promenade when you stop to swim or eat

### E-bikes & Scooters
Electric bikes and scooters are increasingly popular in Split. The same rules apply — use cycling lanes and respect pedestrians.

## Facilities for Athletes

- **Water fountains:** Available along the promenade for refilling bottles
- **Showers:** Public showers at the beach — useful for a post-run cool-down
- **Toilets:** Available at intervals along the promenade
- **Benches:** Plenty of spots to stretch or rest
- **Post-workout meal:** Hit one of the pavilion restaurants — Central Beach and GAL Split are right on the promenade

## Tips

1. **Hydrate** — Carry water, especially in summer. The fountains along the route help.
2. **Sun protection** — Even early morning runs in summer need sunscreen and a cap
3. **Shoes matter** — The promenade is paved but some connecting paths are rougher. Trail shoes not needed, but avoid flip-flops for running
4. **Sunrise runs** are spectacular — the sun rises over the sea on Žnjan's east-facing coastline
5. **Combine with a swim** — Run first, then cool off in the Adriatic. Best post-workout recovery available
