## Is the Water Clean at Žnjan?

**Yes.** The Adriatic Sea along Split's coastline consistently rates as **excellent quality** under EU Bathing Water Directive testing. The water at Žnjan is clear, clean, and safe for swimming.

Croatia takes bathing water quality seriously — the Croatian Institute of Public Health conducts regular testing throughout the swimming season (June–September) at designated bathing sites, including Žnjan.

## Water Quality Ratings

Croatian beaches are tested for two main indicators:

- **Intestinal enterococci** — bacteria that indicate sewage contamination
- **Escherichia coli (E. coli)** — another indicator of faecal contamination

Results are classified as:

| Rating | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Excellent** | Consistently clean, safe for all swimmers |
| **Good** | Minor fluctuations but safe |
| **Sufficient** | Meets minimum standards |
| **Poor** | Not recommended for swimming |

Žnjan's waters typically receive an **"Excellent"** rating. Split's coastline benefits from:
- Strong tidal exchange with the open Adriatic
- Modern wastewater treatment infrastructure
- Rocky/pebble substrate that keeps water clear (no sandy churning)
- Distance from any industrial discharge

## Water Clarity

One thing visitors notice immediately: the Adriatic at Žnjan is **remarkably clear**. Visibility often exceeds 10 metres on calm days. The pebble bottom (rather than sand) means the water doesn't cloud when people walk in.

This makes Žnjan excellent for **snorkeling** — you can see fish, sea urchins, and the rocky seabed clearly, especially around the eastern rocky areas.

## Beach Cleanliness

The €45.5M renovation brought Žnjan up to modern standards for beach maintenance:

### What's in Place

- **Daily cleaning** — Maintenance crews clean the beach and promenade each morning during summer season
- **Waste bins** — Distributed along the promenade at regular intervals
- **Recycling points** — Separate collection for recyclables
- **Public showers** — Free showers along the beach for rinsing off
- **Public toilets** — Maintained facilities at intervals along the promenade
- **Stormwater management** — New drainage infrastructure prevents runoff from reaching the beach

### Beach Surface

Žnjan is a **pebble beach** — smoother and easier to keep clean than sandy beaches. The pebbles dry quickly after rain and don't retain debris the way sand does. They're cleaned mechanically during the season.

## Environmental Standards

### Managed by Žnjan d.o.o.

The beach is managed by **Žnjan d.o.o.**, the company that holds the 40-year concession for the area. Their responsibilities include:

- Beach and promenade maintenance
- Waste collection and disposal
- Lifeguard services
- Facility upkeep (showers, toilets, infrastructure)
- Environmental monitoring

### Smoking

Croatia has no beach-wide smoking ban, but individual beach clubs may restrict smoking in their seating areas. Cigarette butts remain a challenge on all Croatian beaches — please use the bins.

### Plastic & Waste

The Adriatic generally has less plastic pollution than the western Mediterranean, thanks to its enclosed geography and lower population density along Croatian coasts. However, occasional debris from storms or currents can wash up. Cleanup crews address this promptly during the season.

## When Might Water Quality Drop?

Temporary dips in water quality can occur:

1. **After heavy rain** — Stormwater runoff can temporarily affect clarity and quality. Wait 24–48 hours after significant rainfall before swimming if you're cautious.
2. **During strong jugo winds** — Southerly winds can stir sediment and reduce visibility, though this doesn't affect safety.
3. **Algae blooms** — Rare but possible in late summer. The Adriatic occasionally sees mucilage events (harmless but unpleasant). These are uncommon at Žnjan.

**In practice:** Water quality issues are rare and temporary. If you're visiting between June and September, the water will almost certainly be excellent.

## How Žnjan Compares

| Beach | Water Quality | Clarity | Beach Cleanliness |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Žnjan** | Excellent | Very high (pebble bottom) | Excellent (new infrastructure) |
| **Bačvice** | Excellent | Moderate (sandy, can be murky) | Good |
| **Kasjuni** | Excellent | Very high | Good (limited bins) |
| **Firule** | Excellent | High | Good |

Žnjan's advantage: the new infrastructure means it has the **best-maintained facilities** of any beach in Split.

## Tips

1. **Check before you swim** — The Croatian bathing water quality results are published online at [voda.hr](https://voda.hr) (in Croatian, but the data is straightforward)
2. **Avoid swimming after storms** — Wait 24 hours after heavy rain
3. **The eastern rocky areas** offer the clearest water for snorkeling
4. **Report issues** — If you notice pollution or debris, alert the lifeguards or beach management
5. **Bring a reusable water bottle** — Use the promenade drinking fountains instead of buying plastic bottles
