## The Venue

The **Žnjan open-air amphitheatre** was built as part of the €45.77M beach renovation and has quickly become one of Split's most distinctive event venues. Located at the western end of the Žnjan promenade, it combines a seaside setting with purpose-built performance infrastructure.

Its most recognisable feature is the **distinctive steel dome** (kupola) — a striking architectural element that became a visual landmark of the new Žnjan even before the beach opened. Assembly of the dome began in **late 2024** and was completed in **early 2025**. The entire Žnjanski Plato project won a **professional award (nagrada struke)** at the annual Assembly of Civil Engineers, with the amphitheatre as one of its centrepiece achievements.

### Key Features

- **Steel dome structure** — Iconic architectural landmark visible from across the beach
- **Open-air design** — Performances under the stars with Adriatic sea views
- **Modern sound and lighting** — Professional-grade systems for concerts and shows
- **Tiered seating** — Designed for good sightlines from all positions
- **Accessible** — Wheelchair-accessible seating and pathways
- **Central location** — On the promenade, walkable from parking, bus stops, and restaurants
- **Named square** — The amphitheatre sits on **Trg kulture** (Culture Square), one of four named squares in the complex

## What Events Happen Here?

## How to Find the Schedule

The amphitheatre's event schedule isn't always centralised in one place. Best sources:

1. **Žnjan d.o.o.** ([znjan.hr](https://znjan.hr)) — The official operator publishes events on their website and social media (@splitemoj_ on Instagram)
2. **Visit Split** (visitsplit.com) — The city tourism board lists major events
3. **Žnjan venue social media** — Follow the beach clubs and the Žnjan promenade accounts on Instagram
4. **Local event sites** — splitski.portal.hr, slobodnadalmacija.hr (events section)
5. **Hotel concierge** — If staying at a Žnjan hotel, the front desk usually knows what's on
6. **Posters on the promenade** — Events are often advertised on-site

## Getting There for Events

### By Bus
Lines **8 and 15** from Split centre to Žnjan. Last buses usually run until around 11pm — check the schedule for your specific evening.

### By Car
Use the **underground garage** (530 spaces) or outdoor parking (451 spaces). Arrive early for popular events — parking fills up.

### By Uber/Bolt
The most convenient option for evening events — drop-off right at the promenade. Easy to book a ride home after.

### On Foot / By Bike
If staying in the Žnjan area, just walk along the promenade. Bike racks are available.

## Tips for Enjoying Events

3. **Combine with dinner** — Eat at one of the nearby pavilion restaurants before or after
4. **Check for rain** — Open-air events may be cancelled or moved in bad weather
5. **Keep noise respectful** — The amphitheatre is in a residential area
6. **Stay for the walk** — After an event, the illuminated promenade is beautiful for a post-show stroll
