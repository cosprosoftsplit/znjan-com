# Znjan Beach — Factual Verification Report

> Ground truth research document. Generated 2026-02-26. Update with new findings as they emerge.

---

Based on extensive research across multiple search engines, Croatian media, official government sources, and international travel outlets, here is the complete verified factual report on Znjan Beach (Plaza Znjan) in Split, Croatia.

---

## 1. RESTAURANTS, BARS, AND CAFES AT ZNJAN BEACH

### Verified Real Businesses (Pre-Transformation Era)

These businesses have been confirmed through TripAdvisor, Google Maps, Croatian directories, and media coverage:

| Name | Type | Verification | Source |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Cafe Bar Barakuda** | Beach bar/cafe | VERIFIED -- Located directly on Znjan beach, listed on multiple platforms | [Holiday-Link](https://www.holiday-link.com/croatia/middle-dalmatia/split/cafe-bar-barakuda-608), [Top Local Places](https://toplocalplaces.com/croatia/split/bar/cafe-bar-barakuda-plaza-znjan-split/367833636603343) |
| **Taboo Beach Club** | Beach club | VERIFIED -- Has its own website, TripAdvisor listing | [taboo-beach.com](https://www.taboo-beach.com/), [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295370-d17635029-Reviews-Taboo_Beach_Club-Split_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html) |
| **Congo Bar (Congo Caffe & Cuisine)** | Bar/cafe | VERIFIED -- Won design recognition, featured in architectural media | [Arhitektonske Razglednice](http://arhitektonskerazglednice.com/congo-bar-na-znjanu-dizajn-koji-osvaja/) |
| **Konoba Barcarola** | Traditional restaurant | LIKELY VERIFIED -- Described in TripAdvisor reviews as "the best restaurant in the area by far" near Znjan | TripAdvisor user reviews |

### Post-Transformation Hospitality (2025 Onward)

The new Znjan plateau features **11 modular pavilion buildings** designated for hospitality, retail, and recreation. Public tenders for leasing these spaces were completed before the June 2025 opening. The city of Split projects revenue of **millions of euros annually** from cafe and restaurant rents alone.

**Critical caveat:** I could NOT find confirmed names of specific new businesses operating in these 11 pavilions. The pre-transformation businesses (Barakuda, Congo, Taboo) may or may not have continued operating in the new layout. This requires on-the-ground confirmation.

### CRITICAL FLAG: Current Codebase Contains Fabricated Business Names

I reviewed every place listing in `C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\places\` and **none of the five listed businesses can be verified as real establishments**:

**`konoba-marjan.yaml`** -- "Konoba Marjan" does not appear in any search result, directory, or review site as a business at Znjan. "Marjan" is the name of the famous hill/forest park on the opposite (western) side of Split, making this name geographically misleading.

**`caffe-bar-split.yaml`** -- "Caffe Bar Split" is a completely generic name. No evidence this specific establishment exists.

**`pizzeria-adriatic.yaml`** -- "Pizzeria Adriatic" returns no results as a business at Znjan. This reads as an AI-generated placeholder.

**`znjan-beach-bar.yaml`** -- "Znjan Beach Bar" is not a specific business name. Real beach bars at Znjan have distinct names (Barakuda, Congo, Taboo).

**`sup-rental-split.yaml`** -- "SUP Rental Split" is a generic description, not a verified business name. Real water sports operators in the Split area include Water Sports Split (watersportssplit.com), OpenWater (openwater.hr), Split Adventure (splitadventure.com), and Given2Fly Adventures (given2flyadventures.com).

**Recommendation:** All five place entries should be either replaced with verified businesses or clearly marked as placeholder/template content until on-the-ground research can confirm current tenant names in the new pavilions.

## 3. MEDIA MENTIONS AND "MIAMI" COMPARISON

### The "Miami of Split" Nickname -- VERIFIED

This is a real nickname used by media and locals, not an AI fabrication:
- [KUKUVIA guide (2026)](https://kukuvia.com/znjan-beach-split-guide/) uses the headline "Is 'The New Miami of Split' Worth the Hype?"
- The grand opening ceremony was deliberately named **"Ca ce mi Copacabana"** (a reference to the famous Oliver Dragojevic song -- roughly "Why Would I Need Copacabana"), reinforcing the comparison to famous global beach destinations
- The comparison stems from the white stone promenades, rows of planted palm trees, and modern architectural pavilions

### Completion Status -- MOSTLY COMPLETE, SOME FINISHING ONGOING

Multiple sources from summer 2025 indicate:
- The beach, promenades, amphitheater, greenery, sports facilities, and public infrastructure **opened on June 21, 2025**
- **Interior finishing of some pavilion/hospitality buildings** was still ongoing at the time of opening, expected to take "an additional 2-3 months"
- TripAdvisor reviews from late 2025 and into 2026 describe mixed experiences: some areas fully operational ("Everything is fully working, lots of space, great bars, places to eat and relax, clean sea"), while other reviewers noted "maps showing several planned restaurants and bars that have not finished yet"
- One reviewer flagged pricing: "50 euros for 2 sunbeds and an umbrella" was considered excessive

## 5. TRANSPORT -- BUS LINES AND PARKING

### Bus Lines -- VERIFIED

| Line | Route | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Line 15** | Circular route: Duilovo - Znjan - Pazar - Trajektna luka - Duilovo. Stops directly at the beach zone. Operates ~05:05-22:05. Operator: Promet Split d.o.o. | [Moovit](https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-line-15-Split-6178-2942917-77680538-1) |
| **Line 8** | Zvoncac - Znjan. Terminates at Znjan. | [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/%C5%BDnjan/Split) |

**Possibly also Line 7 and Line 17** -- some sources mention these serving the broader Znjan neighborhood, but Lines 8 and 15 are consistently cited as the primary beach-serving routes.

### CODEBASE ERROR FLAGGED

The FAQ file at `C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\faq\general.yaml` states bus lines **"8 and 12"**. Line 12 does NOT serve Znjan according to any source I found. The correct lines are **8 and 15**. This must be corrected.

### Parking -- VERIFIED

| Type | Capacity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **New underground garage** | **530 spaces** | Built as Phase 2 of the transformation. Was free during initial opening in June 2025 |
| **New outdoor parking** | **451 spaces** | Built as part of the transformation |
| **Total new parking** | **~981 spaces** | |

Source: [LiveCamCroatia](https://www.livecamcroatia.com/en/news/the-project-reconstruction-of-znjan/), [Index.hr](https://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nakon-26-godina-cekanja-znjan-dobiva-novi-izgled-pogledajte-sto-ocekuje-splicane/2660655.aspx)

### CODEBASE ERROR FLAGGED

The FAQ file at `C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\faq\parking.yaml` describes parking in vague, outdated terms ("paid parking along the main road," "street parking in surrounding residential area") with **no mention of the underground garage** -- the single largest and most significant parking facility. This needs a complete rewrite.

---

## 6. THE AMPHITHEATER -- CONFIRMED REAL

**YES, the amphitheater exists and is operational.**

Key verified facts:
- It is an **open-air amphitheater** built as a central feature of the transformation
- It includes a **rooftop viewpoint / observation deck**
- It was used for the grand opening concert on June 21, 2025 (Ante Gelo performed)
- It hosts cultural and musical events, community gatherings
- It is designed as the cultural heart of the plateau

The amphitheater content in `C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\beach-areas\amphitheater.yaml` is **factually accurate** in its general description, though it could be enriched with specific details (rooftop viewpoint, the events already held there, its role in the grand opening).

### Water Sports Operators in the Split/Znjan Area

| OpenWater (openwater.hr) | Various water sports | Operates in Split area |

| Given2Fly Adventures (given2flyadventures.com) | Sea kayaking | Operates from Split area |

TripAdvisor reviews confirm that jet-ski rental, parasails, pedal boats, and SUP boards are available at Znjan beach during summer season, but specific operator names at the beach itself require on-the-ground confirmation.

## 10. BASIC BEACH FACTS -- VERIFIED

| Fact | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Beach length | **Over 2 kilometres** | [Seagull Accommodation](https://www.seagull-accommodation.com/beaches-in-split/znjan-beach-the-largest-beach-in-split/), [adriagate.com](https://www.adriagate.com/Croatia-en/Znjan-beach-Croatia) |

| Wheelchair accessible | YES -- accessible paths along main promenade | TripAdvisor, multiple sources |

### CODEBASE ERROR FLAGGED

The FAQ at `C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\faq\general.yaml` states the beach stretches "over 1km." Every source I found says **over 2 kilometres**. This is a significant understatement that should be corrected.

---

## COMPLETE LIST OF CODEBASE ERRORS AND ISSUES

### HIGH PRIORITY -- Factual Errors

1. **`C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\faq\general.yaml`** -- Bus lines listed as "8 and 12" must be corrected to **"8 and 15"**. Beach length "over 1km" must be corrected to **"over 2 kilometres"**.

2. **`C:\Users\ivanb\znjan.com\src\content\faq\parking.yaml`** -- Completely outdated. Must mention the **underground garage (530 spaces)** and **451 outdoor spaces**. Current text describes vague pre-renovation parking only.

3. **All five place listings** (`znjan-beach-bar.yaml`, `konoba-marjan.yaml`, `caffe-bar-split.yaml`, `pizzeria-adriatic.yaml`, `sup-rental-split.yaml`) -- All contain fabricated/generic business names that cannot be verified as real establishments. These should be replaced with verified real businesses (Cafe Bar Barakuda, Taboo Beach Club, Congo Bar, Konoba Barcarola) or clearly marked as templates pending field verification.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY -- Missing Information

4. **Beach areas content** -- Lacks mention of the named public squares (Trg kulture, Vodeni trg, Topografski trg, Trg 14 palmi), the 11 pavilion buildings, and the specific greenery statistics (48,000 m2, 730 trees, 12,815 shrubs).

5. **Activities content** -- Missing the new skate park (1,200 m2), splash pad, climbing frames, basketball courts, cage football, children's playground (600 m2), and diving platforms.

6. **No mention of the 1998 papal visit** -- This is foundational historical context explaining why the artificial plateau exists in the first place.

### LOW PRIORITY -- Enrichment Opportunities

7. Add Znjan d.o.o. as managing entity with contact details.
8. Add the financing breakdown (EU funds, EIB, city budget).
9. Add information about events programming (Advent, HANDS Festival, etc.).
10. Add the grand opening details as a milestone.
11. Add sea temperature data for seasonal planning.
