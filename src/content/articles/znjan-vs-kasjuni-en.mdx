## Two Great Beaches, Totally Different Vibes

If Split's beaches were a menu, **Žnjan** would be the all-you-can-eat buffet — everything you could want in one sprawling 2 km stretch. **Kasjuni** would be the intimate restaurant with the best view in town — small, beautiful, and unforgettable.

Both are excellent. Choosing between them depends entirely on what you're looking for.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Žnjan | Kasjuni |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Beach type** | Pebble | Fine pebble |
| **Length** | 2+ km | ~200 m |
| **Setting** | Urban beachfront | Cove under Marjan Hill |
| **Distance from Old Town** | 4 km (east) | 3 km (west) |
| **Getting there** | Bus 8/15, taxi, car | Walk, taxi, or car |
| **Parking** | 530 underground + 451 outdoor | Small lot (fills fast) |
| **Restaurants** | 11 pavilion venues | 1 beach bar |
| **Lifeguards** | Yes | No |
| **Kids' facilities** | Playgrounds, kids' zone | None |
| **Sports** | Volleyball, SUP, kayak, cycling | Snorkeling |
| **Shade** | Limited natural shade | Pine forest provides natural shade |
| **Crowd level** | Busy but spacious | Small and crowded on weekends |
| **Water clarity** | Clear | Exceptionally clear |
| **Wheelchair accessible** | Yes | No |

## The Setting

**Žnjan** stretches along Split's eastern coastline — it's a proper urban beach with a modern promenade, pavilion buildings, and the city visible in the background. The vibe is lively and social.

**Kasjuni** hides below **Marjan Hill**, Split's beloved forested peninsula. You walk or drive down a winding road through pine trees to reach a small cove. The cliffs and forest create a natural amphitheatre — it feels secluded even though you're minutes from the city.

**Winner:** Kasjuni for natural beauty. Žnjan for infrastructure and convenience.

## Water & Swimming

Both beaches have excellent water quality, but **Kasjuni** edges ahead. The cove's position and rocky seabed mean visibility is extraordinary — you can see the bottom at several metres. The rocks along the edges are great for snorkeling.

**Žnjan** also has clear water (far better than Bačvice), especially at the rocky eastern end. The main beach section has a pebbly floor that's easier to walk on.

**Winner:** Kasjuni for crystal-clear snorkeling. Žnjan for comfortable swimming.

## Facilities

This is where they diverge sharply.

**Žnjan** has everything: 11 restaurants/beach clubs, underground parking, playgrounds, sports courts, accessible paths, showers, toilets, lifeguards, and an amphitheatre. You could spend an entire day without needing anything else.

**Kasjuni** has one beach bar, sunbed rental, and a small parking lot. That's it. Showers are basic, there are no toilets on the beach itself, and no lifeguards.

**Winner:** Žnjan, overwhelmingly.

## Food & Drink

At **Žnjan**, you can choose between Palma Beach Club cocktails, Casa Sol Mediterranean dishes, MIMI Italian fine dining, Taboo's upscale lounge, or a casual meal at GAL Split. The pavilion restaurants operate from around April to October.

At **Kasjuni**, there's one beach bar serving drinks, basic snacks, and light meals. It's pleasant and has a great view, but the options are limited. Many visitors bring their own food.

**Winner:** Žnjan for variety. Kasjuni for bring-your-own picnic charm.

## Getting There & Parking

**Žnjan** is easy to reach: bus lines 8 and 15 run regularly from the centre, taxis cost €6–9, and the 530-space underground garage means parking stress is minimal.

**Kasjuni** is trickier. You can walk from the city (20–25 minutes, partly uphill through Marjan), take a taxi, or drive. The small parking lot above the beach fills up by 10am in summer — if you're driving, arrive very early.

**Winner:** Žnjan for accessibility. Kasjuni if you enjoy the scenic walk through Marjan.

## Family-Friendliness

**Žnjan** is purpose-built for families: a dedicated kids' zone with shallow water, playgrounds, bouncy castles, lifeguards, and multiple restaurants serving children's meals. The flat promenade is stroller-friendly.

**Kasjuni** is not ideal for families with young children. The steep access path, lack of lifeguards, rocky entry, and no playground make it more suited to adults and older kids. However, the natural shade from pine trees is a genuine advantage — no umbrella needed.

**Winner:** Žnjan for families. Kasjuni for couples and groups of adults.

## Crowd & Atmosphere

**Žnjan** is Split's busiest beach, but at 2+ km long, it absorbs the crowds well. Even on the busiest summer Saturday, you can find space. The atmosphere is social and energetic — beach clubs playing music, kids running around, cyclists on the promenade.

**Kasjuni** feels intimate and relaxed. At 200 m, it's small, and on summer weekends it can feel packed. But on a weekday morning, it's a slice of Mediterranean paradise — pine-scented air, turquoise water, barely a sound.

**Winner:** Kasjuni for peace (weekdays). Žnjan for energy and space (any day).

## The Best Plan: Do Both

Since Žnjan and Kasjuni are on opposite sides of Split, combining them in one trip requires some travel. But here's how:

**Morning at Kasjuni** — Arrive by 9am, grab a prime spot under the pines, enjoy the crystal-clear water while it's quiet. Swim, snorkel, relax.

**Lunch & Afternoon at Žnjan** — Bus or taxi east to Žnjan. Have lunch at one of the pavilion restaurants, then spend the afternoon at the sports zone or beach clubs. Stay for sunset cocktails on the promenade.

This gives you the best of both worlds: Kasjuni's natural beauty in the morning and Žnjan's facilities and social scene in the afternoon.

## The Verdict

**Choose Žnjan if:**
- You want facilities, dining, and entertainment
- You're visiting with kids
- You value accessibility and parking
- You prefer a lively atmosphere

**Choose Kasjuni if:**
- You prioritise natural beauty and tranquillity
- You love snorkeling
- You enjoy a more rustic, undeveloped beach
- You're visiting as a couple or with friends (no young kids)

Both are among Split's finest. You really can't go wrong.
