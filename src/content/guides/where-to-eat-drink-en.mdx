## The New Dining Scene at Znjan

The €45.5M transformation of Znjan Beach didn't just reshape the sand and promenade — it created an entirely new dining landscape. The **11 new pavilion buildings**, awarded through FINA auction with 10-year leases, now house some of Split's most exciting restaurants and beach clubs.

## Tips for Dining at Znjan

1. **Book ahead for dinner** — The most popular venues fill up fast in July and August, especially for sunset tables
2. **Lunch is more relaxed** — You can usually walk in for lunch even at peak season
3. **Ask about daily catches** — Many restaurants serve fresh fish bought that morning from local fishermen
4. **Try local wine** — Croatian wines from Dalmatia (especially Plavac Mali reds and Pošip whites) are excellent and often better value than imported labels
5. **Sunset timing** — For the best experience, book a table for around 7:30pm in summer to catch the sunset over the islands

## What's Still Coming

With 11 pavilion buildings in total and new leases still being established, the dining scene at Znjan continues to evolve. Keep checking back — we'll update this guide as new venues open.
