## The Name

"Žnjan" (pronounced roughly "ZHNY-an") comes from old Croatian/Dalmatian vocabulary. The exact etymology is debated, but it's believed to derive from a term related to the coastal landscape of the area. In Split, place names often reflect centuries of Dalmatian, Venetian, and Croatian linguistic layers.

## Early History

For most of its history, the Žnjan area was a **quiet stretch of coast** on Split's southeastern peninsula. While the Old Town (Diocletian's Palace, built around 305 AD) developed on the western side, the eastern coastline remained rural — used for fishing, agriculture, and grazing.

The pebble shore was used by local fishermen and, in summer, by families from nearby neighbourhoods who came to swim. There was no formal infrastructure — no promenade, no facilities, just coastline.

## The Yugoslav Era (1945–1991)

During the socialist period, Split expanded rapidly eastward. The Žnjan neighbourhood developed as a **residential area** with apartment blocks typical of Yugoslav urban planning. The beach itself remained largely undeveloped compared to Bačvice, which got more attention as Split's "city beach" due to its central location and sandy shore.

However, Žnjan gained a reputation among locals as a **longer, more spacious alternative** to the smaller city beaches. Families would bring their own equipment and spend the day on the pebble shore.

## The 1990s–2000s: Informal Development

After Croatian independence (1991), the beach area saw **informal commercial development**:

- Small beach bars and cafes appeared along the shore
- Water sports operators set up rental operations
- Parking became chaotic as the area grew popular
- Infrastructure lagged behind — limited toilets, showers, or proper paths

By the early 2000s, Žnjan was Split's most-visited beach by sheer footfall, but its facilities didn't match its popularity. The contrast between the beautiful coastline and the lack of infrastructure became a running topic in local politics.

## The Concession & Planning (2010s)

The City of Split recognised that Žnjan needed comprehensive redevelopment. The process included:

- **2015–2018:** Planning and design phase, public consultations
- **Žnjan d.o.o.** established to manage the beach under a **40-year concession**
- Architectural competitions for the pavilion buildings
- Environmental impact assessments
- Coordination with national and EU infrastructure standards

The vision: transform Žnjan into a **world-class urban beach** while maintaining public access and the Dalmatian character of the coastline.

## The €45.5M Transformation (2020s)

The renovation project — one of the largest public beach investments in Croatia — included:

### Infrastructure

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Promenade** | 2+ km redesigned, separated pedestrian and cycling lanes |
| **Pavilion buildings** | 11 new structures for restaurants, bars, and beach clubs |
| **Underground garage** | 530 parking spaces |
| **Outdoor parking** | 451 spaces |
| **Amphitheatre** | Open-air venue for concerts and events |
| **Landscaping** | 730 trees, 12,815 shrubs, 48,000 m² green space |
| **Utilities** | Complete water, sewage, and electrical infrastructure |

### Design Philosophy

The pavilion buildings were designed to be **architecturally cohesive** — modern Mediterranean style that complements the coastline rather than dominating it. The structures are low-rise, use natural materials, and maintain sight lines to the sea from the promenade.

### Public Access

A key principle of the renovation: **the beach remains free and public**. The pavilion businesses operate on 10-year leases awarded through public auction (via FINA), but the beach itself, the promenade, and all public facilities are open to everyone without charge.

## The "Miami of Split"

The transformation earned Žnjan the nickname **"Miami of Split"** in Croatian and international media. The comparison — while flattering — refers to the beach club culture, the illuminated promenade, and the upscale feel of the new pavilion venues.

The name stuck because Žnjan genuinely transformed from an underdeveloped pebble beach into a modern, designed beach destination. The scale of change was dramatic — visitors who knew the old Žnjan barely recognise the new one.

## The Beach Reopened: June 21, 2025

After years of construction, **Žnjan officially reopened on June 21, 2025**. The opening drew large crowds and significant media attention. The first season (summer 2025) was a success, establishing Žnjan as Split's premier beach destination.

## The Neighbourhood Today

Žnjan is no longer just a beach — it's become one of Split's most desirable **residential neighbourhoods**:

- Modern apartment buildings alongside older residential blocks
- Growing hospitality sector (new hotels including the upcoming Mövenpick)
- Excellent transport links (bus lines 8 and 15 to the city centre)
- Supermarkets, pharmacies, and services within walking distance
- A neighbourhood that combines beach lifestyle with urban convenience

## What's Next?

The Žnjan area continues to develop:

- **Mövenpick Hotel** — Croatia's first Mövenpick property, opening in 2026
- **Additional hospitality venues** — Some of the 11 pavilion buildings are still being fitted out
- **Cultural programming** — The amphitheatre's event calendar is expanding each season
- **Transport improvements** — Discussions about enhanced cycling infrastructure connecting Žnjan to the wider Split network

Žnjan's story is one of a neighbourhood catching up to its potential. The coastline was always beautiful — now the infrastructure matches it.
