## A Beach Built for Activity

Znjan Beach isn't just for sunbathing. The 2km stretch of coastline, redesigned with the €45.5M transformation, now features dedicated sports zones, water sports rental points, a cycling-friendly promenade, and some of the best swimming conditions in Split.

Here's everything you can do at Znjan.

## Water Activities

### Swimming
The main beach has clean, clear Adriatic waters with a gentle pebble entry. **Lifeguards are on duty from June through September** during peak hours. Water temperatures range from 22°C in early June to 26°C in August.

**Best spots:** The main beach for families (gentle entry, lifeguards), the eastern rocky area for more experienced swimmers.

### Stand-Up Paddleboarding (SUP)
SUP has become one of the most popular activities at Znjan. Several rental points operate along the beach during summer. No experience needed — the calm morning waters are perfect for beginners.

- **Season:** May–October
- **Typical cost:** €10–15 per hour
- **Best time:** Early morning (before 10am) when the sea is calmest

### Kayaking
Explore the coastline from a different perspective. Kayak rentals are available at the sports zone. You can paddle along the coast towards Stobreč or simply cruise along the Znjan shoreline.

- **Season:** May–October
- **Typical cost:** €12–18 per hour
- **Best for:** Couples, adventurous families

### Snorkeling
The rocky eastern end of Znjan Beach offers the best snorkeling. The underwater landscape includes rocky formations with small fish, sea urchins, and occasional octopus sightings. Bring your own gear or rent from beach vendors.

**Tip:** Go early morning for the best visibility. The water is clearest before the crowds stir up the bottom.

## Beach Sports

### Beach Volleyball
Multiple courts are available in the dedicated sports zone. During summer, you'll find both casual pick-up games and organised tournaments. Some courts can be reserved.

- **Location:** Sports zone, central area
- **Cost:** Free for public courts
- **Season:** Year-round (weather permitting)

### Beach Tennis & Badminton
Flat areas near the sports zone are popular for beach tennis and badminton. Bring your own equipment or check with nearby rental shops.

## Land Activities

### Cycling the Promenade
The redesigned 2km promenade is flat, well-paved, and perfect for cycling. It connects to Split's broader cycling network, making it easy to combine a beach day with a longer ride along the coast.

- **Rental:** Available from several points near the beach
- **Typical cost:** €8–12 per day for a city bike
- **Route:** The promenade extends from the main beach area past the Radisson Blu towards Stobreč

### Running & Jogging
The promenade is equally popular with runners. The flat, sea-level path with constant ocean views makes for a scenic and comfortable run. Morning and evening are the most popular times.

### Walking & Sunset Strolls
Don't underestimate the simple pleasure of walking the promenade. With the new landscaping, seating areas, and restaurant terraces, it's become one of Split's finest evening walks. The western-facing sections offer stunning sunset views over the islands of Brač and Šolta.

## Family Activities

### Kids' Play Areas
The transformation included dedicated children's zones with:
- Shallow water entry points
- Playground equipment near the beach
- Shaded areas for families

### Building Sand Castles (Sort Of)
Znjan is a pebble beach, not sand. But the kids' areas have softer surfaces and shallow pools that are perfect for small children.

## What to Bring

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Water shoes | The beach is pebble — more comfortable than barefoot |
