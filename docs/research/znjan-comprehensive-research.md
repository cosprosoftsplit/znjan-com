## 16. CONTENT GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following areas would benefit from additional direct research or outreach before publishing on the portal:

1. **Specific venue names for the 11 new concession hospitality spots** -- these were being opened in phases post-June 2025 and names were not fully public at research time. Recommend contacting Znjan d.o.o. directly.
2. **Current parking prices** -- were free at launch; pricing likely changed for the 2026 season.
3. **Sunbed/umbrella exact pricing** -- varies by vendor and season; should be verified on-site.
4. **Amphitheater capacity** -- not found in any public source.
5. **2026 summer event calendar** -- likely to be published by Split Tourism Board closer to summer.
6. **Blue Flag certification status** -- not confirmed for Znjan specifically; worth verifying with the Croatian Ministry of Tourism.
7. **Specific water sports rental operators** -- individual SUP/kayak rental companies at the new Znjan were not yet named in sources.
8. **Movenpick Hotel opening date** -- confirmed for "2026 season" but no exact month found.
