## The Biggest Beach Transformation in Croatia's History

On **June 21, 2025**, Split officially unveiled a completely reborn Žnjan Beach — the culmination of a **€45.5 million investment** and over a year of intensive construction. The project represents the **largest coastal development in Split in 50 years** and has transformed a neglected, chaotic stretch of coastline into a world-class beachfront that locals now proudly call the "Miami of Split."

## What Was Žnjan Like Before?

For decades, Žnjan Beach was Split's biggest missed opportunity. Despite being the city's longest beach at over 2 kilometres, it suffered from:

- **Chaotic parking** — Cars parked haphazardly on dirt lots, creating dust and congestion
- **Crumbling infrastructure** — Outdated water, sewage, and electrical systems
- **Informal food stalls** — A mix of temporary stands with inconsistent quality
- **No proper promenade** — Pedestrians competed with cars and cyclists on narrow paths
- **Limited accessibility** — No wheelchair ramps, no proper pathways
- **Neglected greenery** — Sparse vegetation and bare concrete

Despite these problems, Split residents loved Žnjan for its long shoreline, shallow-entry areas for kids, and eastward-facing position that caught the morning sun. It was always packed in summer — just not comfortable.

## The Vision: Žnjanski Plato

The City of Split, working through the newly formed **Žnjan d.o.o.** (a city-owned company with a **40-year management concession**), designed an ambitious master plan for the entire Žnjan Plateau. The project covered an area equivalent to **31 football pitches**.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Public-first** — All beaches, promenades, and public areas remain free and accessible
2. **Sustainable** — Native Mediterranean plantings, modern drainage, energy-efficient infrastructure
3. **Mixed-use** — Commercial pavilions alongside public amenities
4. **Accessible** — Full wheelchair and stroller access throughout

## The Numbers

| What | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Total investment** | €45.5 million |
| **Construction start** | February 2024 |
| **Official opening** | June 21, 2025 |
| **Area covered** | Equivalent to 31 football pitches |
| **New pavilion buildings** | 11 (awarded via FINA auction, 10-year leases) |
| **Underground parking** | 530 spaces |
| **Outdoor parking** | 451 spaces |
| **Trees planted** | 730 trees and palm trees |
| **Shrubs planted** | 12,815 autochthonous shrubs and perennials |
| **Green area** | 48,000 m² (Split's second-largest after Marjan) |
| **Promenade length** | 2+ kilometres |
| **Managing entity** | Žnjan d.o.o. (40-year concession) |

## What Changed: The Before & After

### Infrastructure

**Before:** Crumbling pipes, frequent sewage issues, unreliable electricity for vendors.
**After:** Completely new underground infrastructure — water mains, sewage system, electrical grid, and fibre-optic connectivity. Everything is built to modern EU standards.

### Parking

**Before:** Chaotic dirt lots, cars parked on grass, dust clouds in summer.
**After:** A **530-space underground garage** keeps cars out of sight, plus **451 organised outdoor spots**. The surface is now pedestrian-friendly with proper walkways.

### The Promenade

**Before:** A narrow, uneven path shared by pedestrians, cyclists, and occasionally cars.
**After:** A **2+ kilometre redesigned promenade** with separate lanes for pedestrians and cyclists, lined with native plantings, benches, and lighting. It connects all beach zones seamlessly.

### Dining and Nightlife

**Before:** Informal stands, a few beach bars of varying quality.
**After:** **11 brand-new pavilion buildings** housing premium beach clubs, restaurants, and bars — including Palma Beach Club, Taboo Beach Club, Casa Sol, Central Beach, MIMI Italian Clubino, and GAL Split. All were awarded through transparent FINA auctions with 10-year lease terms.

### Green Spaces

**Before:** Bare concrete and sparse vegetation.
**After:** **48,000 m² of landscaped greenery** — making Žnjan Split's second-largest green area after Marjan Park. The planting includes **730 trees and palms** and over **12,800 native shrubs**.

### The Amphitheatre

One of the most exciting additions: an **open-air amphitheatre** built into the beachfront, designed for concerts, festivals, cinema screenings, and community events. It takes advantage of the natural sea-view backdrop and summer evening breezes.

### Accessibility

**Before:** No wheelchair access, no accessible toilets, rocky and uneven terrain.
**After:** Full **wheelchair-accessible paths and ramps** from the promenade to the beach. A **sea-access elevator** for swimmers with mobility challenges. Accessible toilets, showers, and **10 reserved disabled parking spaces** connected directly to the beach via an access path.

### Kids' Facilities

**Before:** A few worn-out playground structures.
**After:** Modern playgrounds, splash areas, and a dedicated kids' beach zone with shallow, calm water. Bouncy castles and trampolines operate in summer season.

## The New Miami of Split

The transformation quickly earned Žnjan the nickname "**Miami of Split**" — not for flash or excess, but for the quality of the beachfront experience:

- **Modern architecture** blending Mediterranean and contemporary design
- **Palm-lined promenade** reminiscent of oceanfront walkways
- **Premium beach clubs** with loungers, cocktails, and DJ sets
- **Active lifestyle amenities** — volleyball courts, cycling paths, running routes
- **Evening atmosphere** — illuminated promenade, amphitheatre events, beachfront dining

The comparison is flattering but Žnjan has its own character. It's distinctly Croatian — the pebble beach, the crystal-clear Adriatic, the smell of grilled fish from the pavilion restaurants, and the relaxed Mediterranean pace.

## How the Pavilion Buildings Work

The 11 pavilion buildings are the commercial heart of the new Žnjan. Here's how they were allocated:

1. **FINA auction process** — Transparent public bidding ensured fair market rates
2. **10-year lease terms** — Long enough for operators to invest in quality fitouts
3. **Design guidelines** — All buildings follow an architectural master plan for visual consistency
4. **Public benefit requirements** — Operators must maintain public access to surrounding areas

Current confirmed operators include **Palma Beach Club**, **Taboo Beach Club**, **Mistral Beach Club** (at Radisson Blu), **Casa Sol**, **Central Beach**, **MIMI Italian Clubino** (F Group), and **GAL Split**, with more opening as pavilions are completed.

## What's Still Coming

While the beach is fully operational, some elements continue to develop:

- **Additional pavilion openings** — Not all 11 buildings were occupied at launch
- **Landscaping maturation** — The 730 newly planted trees will grow to full canopy over several years
- **Cultural programming** — The amphitheatre's event calendar expands each season
- **Mövenpick Hotel Žnjan** — Croatia's first Mövenpick hotel opens in 2026, adding a rooftop infinity pool and 120+ rooms overlooking the beach

## Visiting the New Žnjan

The best way to experience the transformation is to visit. The beach is open year-round (venues are seasonal, June–September), and the promenade is perfect for walking or cycling any time.

**Getting there:** Bus lines **8 and 15** from Split centre, or 10 minutes by car/taxi.

**Parking:** Underground garage (530 spaces) + outdoor lots (451 spaces).

**Cost:** The beach and promenade are completely **free**. Sunbed rental at beach clubs ranges from €20–50 depending on the venue.

## The Impact

The Žnjan transformation is more than a beach renovation — it's a statement about Split's future as a year-round Mediterranean destination. It adds:

- **Green infrastructure** to a city that needed it
- **Quality hospitality venues** that compete with Dubrovnik and Hvar
- **Accessible public space** that serves residents and visitors equally
- **Economic activity** through tourism, hospitality jobs, and property value increases

Žnjan is proof that public investment in coastal infrastructure pays off — and that the "Miami of Split" is more than just a nickname.
