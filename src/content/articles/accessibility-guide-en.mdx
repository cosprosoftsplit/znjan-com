## Overview

Žnjan Beach is one of the **most accessible beaches in Split**, thanks to the €45.5M renovation that was designed with universal access in mind. The redesigned promenade, ramps, and adapted facilities make it significantly more usable for visitors with mobility impairments than most Croatian beaches.

## Promenade Accessibility

The 2+ km **promenade is fully wheelchair accessible**:

- **Wide, flat surface** — Smooth paving throughout, wide enough for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, and strollers side by side
- **No steps on the main promenade** — Continuous flat path the entire length
- **Gentle gradients** — Where level changes exist, ramps are provided
- **Tactile paving** — In key areas for visitors with visual impairments
- **Rest areas** — Benches at regular intervals along the route
- **Shade** — Some sections have tree cover for rest stops out of the sun

The promenade alone makes Žnjan worth visiting for anyone with mobility challenges — it's one of the finest accessible coastal walks in Croatia.

## Beach Access

### Getting to the Water

The main challenge at any pebble beach is crossing the pebbles to reach the sea. Žnjan addresses this with:

- **Accessible ramps** leading from the promenade level down to beach level at multiple points
- **Adapted beach areas** with level access closer to the waterline
- **Sea entry aids** — Equipment to assist wheelchair users into the water is available at designated accessible swimming zones during summer season (June–September). Check with lifeguards for current availability and locations.

### Beach Surface

Žnjan's pebble surface is **challenging for standard wheelchairs**. Options:

- **Beach wheelchair** — Some adapted beach wheelchairs with wide wheels are available (check with lifeguards during summer season)
- **Beach mats** — Rollable access mats may be deployed at accessible zones to provide a stable path to the water
- **The promenade itself** offers excellent sea views and access to all restaurants without needing to go onto the pebbles

## Facilities

### Accessible Toilets

Adapted public toilets are available along the promenade. They feature:
- Wide doors for wheelchair access
- Grab rails
- Lower fixtures
- Located at several points along the 2 km route

### Accessible Showers

Some of the public shower points along the beach are designed to be accessible for wheelchair users.

### Parking

The **underground parking garage** (530 spaces) has designated accessible parking spaces near the elevators. The outdoor parking areas (451 spaces) also have accessible spots. From the garage, elevator access brings you to promenade level.

### Restaurants & Beach Clubs

Most of the new **pavilion buildings** (11 in total) were designed with accessibility in mind:
- Step-free or ramped access to most venues
- Accessible seating areas
- Accessible toilets in larger venues

However, some smaller venues may have limited accessibility. Check in advance for specific requirements.

## Tips for Visitors with Disabilities

1. **Arrive via the underground garage** — It has the best accessible parking and elevator access to the promenade
2. **Contact lifeguards** about sea entry assistance — Available during summer season
3. **The promenade is the star** — Even if getting onto the pebbles is challenging, the promenade offers full access to the Žnjan experience (views, restaurants, atmosphere)
4. **Visit in the morning** — Fewer crowds mean easier navigation and more space
5. **Bring sun protection** — Shade is limited on the beach itself, though the promenade has some tree cover
6. **Bus accessibility** — Split city buses (lines 8 and 15 to Žnjan) have low-floor vehicles, though availability varies

## Accessibility for Other Needs

### Visual Impairments
- Tactile paving is present in key areas
- The flat, obstacle-free promenade is relatively easy to navigate
- Beach clubs and restaurants are staffed and can assist

### Hearing Impairments
- Lifeguard flags (visual signals) are used for water safety: red = no swimming, yellow = caution, green = safe
- Most restaurants have menus you can read (multilingual)

### Sensory Sensitivities
- **Quieter times:** Early morning (before 10am) or September when crowds are lower
- **Quieter zones:** Eastern end of the beach, away from beach clubs and music
- The open-air environment and sea sounds can be calming, but beach clubs play music during the day in summer

### Travelling with Mobility Equipment
- **Wheelchair rental in Split:** Medical supply shops in the city can arrange short-term rental
- **Mobility scooter:** The promenade is suitable for mobility scooters — wide and flat
- **Walking frames/sticks:** The paved promenade surface is stable and suitable
