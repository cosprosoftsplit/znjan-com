## After Dark at Žnjan

The €45.5M transformation didn't just upgrade Žnjan for daytime beachgoers — it created Split's most exciting evening destination. The 11 new pavilion buildings include several beach clubs that transition from daytime lounging to evening cocktails and DJ sets. The illuminated promenade adds atmosphere, and the open-air amphitheatre hosts concerts and cultural events throughout summer.

## Beach Clubs

### Taboo Beach Club
The premium nightlife option at Žnjan. Taboo features upscale lounging areas, a full cocktail menu, and regular DJ sets on weekends throughout summer. The vibe is sophisticated — think Ibiza-lite on the Adriatic.

- **Music:** DJ sets (house, deep house, chill) from Thursday to Sunday
- **Dress code:** Smart casual in the evening — no flip-flops after sunset
- **Cocktails:** €10–14
- **Best for:** Couples, groups of friends, anyone wanting a premium night out
- **Website:** [taboo-beach.com](https://taboo-beach.com)

### Palma Beach Club
A more relaxed vibe than Taboo but still elevated. Palma offers beachfront cocktails with palm-tree-lined seating and occasional live music. Perfect for sunset drinks that extend into the evening.

- **Music:** Background beats, occasional live acoustic sets
- **Vibe:** Relaxed, social, palm-beach aesthetic
- **Cocktails:** €8–12
- **Best for:** Sunset drinks, casual evenings, groups
- **Website:** [palmabeachclub.com](https://palmabeachclub.com)

### Mistral Beach Club
Located at the Radisson Blu Resort, Mistral has been a Žnjan fixture for years. It offers a more resort-style evening experience with quality cocktails and views.

- **Music:** Background music, mellow vibe
- **Cocktails:** €8–12
- **Best for:** Hotel guests, couples, relaxed evenings
- **Website:** [mistralbeachclub.com](https://mistralbeachclub.com)

## The Promenade at Night

The redesigned 2 km promenade is **illuminated** after dark, creating one of Split's most pleasant evening walks. Restaurants and bars stay open late, and the atmosphere is lively but not rowdy.

**What to expect:** Families strolling, couples having cocktails at the pavilion venues, groups of friends bar-hopping along the beachfront. It's busy but spacious — never the sardine-can feeling of some city nightlife districts.

## The Amphitheatre

The new **open-air amphitheatre** is designed for concerts, cinema screenings, cultural performances, and community events. During summer:

- **Concerts** featuring Croatian and international artists
- **Outdoor cinema** screenings on select evenings
- **Cultural festivals** and community events

Check local event listings or the Visit Split website for the current schedule. Many amphitheatre events are **free** or modestly priced.

## Evening Timeline

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|-----------------|
| **7–8pm** | Sunset — prime cocktail hour at beach clubs |
| **8–9pm** | Dinner at pavilion restaurants |
| **9–10pm** | Promenade fills up with evening strollers |
| **10pm–midnight** | DJ sets start at Taboo, bars lively |
| **After midnight** | Taboo continues, other venues wind down |

## Compared to Other Split Nightlife

Žnjan's nightlife is **beachfront and relatively mellow** compared to the city centre's club scene:

- **For clubbing until 4am:** Head to the city centre (Riva area, bars in the Old Town)
- **For sophisticated beachfront evenings:** Žnjan is the best option in Split
- **For a relaxed drink with sea views:** Žnjan wins hands down
- **For live music variety:** Check both Žnjan amphitheatre and city centre venues

## Tips for a Great Evening at Žnjan

1. **Arrive for sunset** (~8pm in summer) — the golden hour light on the Adriatic is stunning
2. **Book ahead** at Taboo on weekends — popular tables fill up
3. **Dress appropriately** — beach clubs expect smart casual after dark, not swimwear
4. **The promenade is safe** at night — well-lit and populated
5. **Getting home:** Book Uber/Bolt from the app, or take a late bus (check schedule)
6. **Budget:** Expect €20–40 per person for an evening of cocktails
