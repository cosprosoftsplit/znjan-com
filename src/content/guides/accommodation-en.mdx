## Why Stay Near Žnjan?

Žnjan is Split's largest beach neighbourhood — and after the €45.5M renovation, it's become one of the city's most desirable areas. Staying here puts you within walking distance of 2+ km of beachfront, pavilion restaurants, and the illuminated promenade, while the Old Town (Diocletian's Palace) is just 15–20 minutes away by bus.

**Key advantages:**
- Walk to the beach in minutes (no fighting for parking)
- Quieter and more spacious than the city centre
- Excellent restaurants right on your doorstep
- Good bus connections (lines 8 and 15) to the centre
- New infrastructure — everything is modern and well-maintained

### Tips for Booking

1. **Book early for July–August** — Žnjan is popular and the best apartments fill up by April
2. **Look for "Žnjan" or "Split III" in the address** — this ensures you're in the beach neighbourhood
3. **Check walking distance to beach** — anything under 10 minutes is ideal
4. **Air conditioning is essential** in summer — verify before booking
5. **Parking:** Ask about parking availability, especially if renting a car
6. **Kitchen access:** Having a kitchen saves money on meals (buy groceries at Konzum or Studenac)

### Best Streets for Apartments

- **Šetalište Pape Ivana Pavla II** — Right on the promenade (most expensive but unbeatable location)
- **Bračka ulica** — One block from the beach, good value
- **Žnjanska ulica** — In the neighbourhood, 5–10 minute walk
- **Velebitska ulica** — Slightly inland, more affordable

## Getting from Your Hotel to the Beach

All Žnjan hotels are within walking distance of the beach. If you're staying in the city centre:

- **Bus lines 8 and 15** run frequently from the centre to Žnjan (15–20 min)
- **Uber/Bolt** costs approximately €5–8 from the Old Town
- **Cycling** along the coastal path takes about 15 minutes from Bačvice

## Booking Tips

1. **Best value:** September — warm water (24°C), fewer crowds, lower prices
2. **Book direct** for hotels — sometimes cheaper than booking sites
3. **Read recent reviews** — the renovation changed the area dramatically, so older reviews may be outdated
4. **Consider location vs price** — a slightly more expensive beachfront apartment saves on transport and parking
5. **Long stays (7+ nights)** often get discounts, especially with apartments
