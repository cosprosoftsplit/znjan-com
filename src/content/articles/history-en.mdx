## The Name

"Žnjan" (pronounced roughly "ZHNY-an") comes from old Croatian/Dalmatian vocabulary. The exact etymology is debated, but it's believed to derive from a term related to the coastal landscape of the area. In Split, place names often reflect centuries of Dalmatian, Venetian, and Croatian linguistic layers.

## Early History

For most of its history, the Žnjan area was a **quiet stretch of coast** on Split's southeastern peninsula. While the Old Town (Diocletian's Palace, built around 305 AD) developed on the western side, the eastern coastline remained rural — used for fishing, agriculture, and grazing.

The pebble shore was used by local fishermen and, in summer, by families from nearby neighbourhoods who came to swim. There was no formal infrastructure — no promenade, no facilities, just coastline.

## The Yugoslav Era (1945–1991)

During the socialist period, Split expanded rapidly eastward. The Žnjan neighbourhood developed as a **residential area** with apartment blocks typical of Yugoslav urban planning. The beach itself remained largely undeveloped compared to Bačvice, which got more attention as Split's "city beach" due to its central location and sandy shore.

However, Žnjan gained a reputation among locals as a **longer, more spacious alternative** to the smaller city beaches. Families would bring their own equipment and spend the day on the pebble shore.

## The 1990s–2000s: Informal Development

After Croatian independence (1991), the beach area saw **informal commercial development**:

- Small beach bars and cafes appeared along the shore
- Water sports operators set up rental operations
- Parking became chaotic as the area grew popular
- Infrastructure lagged behind — limited toilets, showers, or proper paths

By the early 2000s, Žnjan was Split's most-visited beach by sheer footfall, but its facilities didn't match its popularity. The contrast between the beautiful coastline and the lack of infrastructure became a running topic in local politics.

## The Concession & Planning (1998–2020s)

The idea of transforming Žnjan dates back further than most realise. The **project origins go back to 1998**, but it took decades to gather the political will and funding.

Key milestones in the planning phase:

- **1998:** First formal plans for a comprehensive Žnjan beach development
- **2014:** The City of Split establishes **Spalatum D.M.C. d.o.o.** (a city-owned tourism company), later renamed to **Žnjan d.o.o.** in 2021
- **2017:** An **international architectural competition** is held for the Žnjan Plateau design
- **February 2018:** Architect **Ante Kuzmanić** is selected as the competition winner — his design prioritised public space, green infrastructure, and Mediterranean identity
- **November 2022:** Žnjan d.o.o. signs a **40-year concession** with the Croatian government for the entire beach complex
- Environmental impact assessments and coordination with EU infrastructure standards

The vision: transform Žnjan into a **world-class urban beach** while maintaining public access and the Dalmatian character of the coastline.

## The €45.77M Transformation (2024–2025)

The renovation — officially titled the **Žnjanski Plato** project — was one of the largest public beach investments in Croatian history. Funded by a **€45.77 million investment** including **€13.94 million from the European Regional Development Fund** (78.49% of €17.76M eligible costs under the ITU Programme 2021–2027).

### Timeline

### Key Parties

- **Architect:** Ante Kuzmanić (competition winner, 2018)
- **Main contractor:** Lavčević d.d. + Lavčević-inženjering d.o.o. (Split)
- **Supervision:** Geoprojekt d.d. + Sedra Consulting d.o.o.
- **Managing entity:** Žnjan d.o.o. (director: Marijan Ciprijan)

### Infrastructure

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Total concession area** | 218,322 m² (sea: 95,176 + land: 123,146) |
| **Promenade** | 2+ km redesigned, separated pedestrian and cycling lanes |
| **Pavilion buildings** | 11 new structures (3 restaurants, 6 bistro/cafés, 1 mini market, 1 kiosk) |
| **Underground garage** | 530 parking spaces (2 levels) |
| **Outdoor parking** | 451 spaces |
| **Amphitheatre** | Open-air venue with distinctive steel dome |
| **Landscaping** | ~730 trees/palms, 12,815 native shrubs, ~48,000 m² green space |
| **Skate park** | ~1,200 m² |
| **Playground** | ~600 m² |
| **Utilities** | Complete water, sewage, electrical, and fibre-optic infrastructure |

### Design Philosophy

Ante Kuzmanić's design prioritised **public space, green infrastructure, and Mediterranean identity**. The pavilion buildings are **architecturally cohesive** — modern Mediterranean style that complements the coastline rather than dominating it. The structures are low-rise, use natural materials, and maintain sight lines to the sea from the promenade.

### Public Access

A key principle of the renovation: **the beach remains free and public**. The pavilion businesses operate on 10-year leases awarded through transparent FINA auction (December 2024), generating **€2.8 million in annual lease revenue** for the city. The beach itself, the promenade, and all public facilities are open to everyone without charge.

## The "Miami of Split"

The transformation earned Žnjan the nickname **"Miami of Split"** in Croatian and international media. The comparison — while flattering — refers to the beach club culture, the illuminated promenade, and the upscale feel of the new pavilion venues.

The name stuck because Žnjan genuinely transformed from an underdeveloped pebble beach into a modern, designed beach destination. The scale of change was dramatic — visitors who knew the old Žnjan barely recognise the new one.

## The Grand Opening: June 21, 2025

On **Saturday, June 21, 2025** — the first day of summer — Split officially unveiled the reborn Žnjan Beach. Mayor **Tomislav Šuta** declared: *"We have gained a location that represents more than just a beach. It's a gathering place for citizens to enjoy various events, cultural activities, and sports programs vital to Split."*

The ceremony was attended by Minister **Tonči Glavina**, members of parliament, and city officials. Entertainment included performances by **TBF**, **Ante Gelo with orchestra**, **Zorica Kondža**, **Albina**, **Goran Karan**, and **Tajči**, along with contemporary dance, acrobatics, a **drone light show**, and **fireworks** — hosted by **Iva Šulentić** and **Tarik Filipović**.

The opening slogan captured the local pride: *"Pored našeg Žnjana, ča će nam Copacabana"* ("Beside our Žnjan, who needs Copacabana").

The first season (summer 2025) was a success, establishing Žnjan as Split's premier beach destination.

## The Neighbourhood Today

Žnjan is no longer just a beach — it's become one of Split's most desirable **residential neighbourhoods**:

- Modern apartment buildings alongside older residential blocks
- Growing hospitality sector (new hotels including the upcoming Mövenpick)
- Excellent transport links (bus lines 8 and 15 to the city centre)
- Supermarkets, pharmacies, and services within walking distance
- A neighbourhood that combines beach lifestyle with urban convenience

## What's Next?

The Žnjan area continues to develop:

- **Mövenpick Hotel Žnjan** — Croatia's first Mövenpick property, opening in 2026 with a rooftop infinity pool and 156 rooms
- **Aquapark** — A public tender has been issued for an aquapark concession within the beach complex
- **Diving & windsurfing clubs** — Separate concession tenders for dedicated water sports facilities
- **Tourist medical clinic** — A 36.57 m² facility to operate June–September
- **Cultural programming** — The amphitheatre's event calendar is expanding each season
- **Landscaping maturation** — The 730 newly planted trees will grow to full canopy over coming years

Žnjan's story is one of a neighbourhood catching up to its potential. The coastline was always beautiful — now the infrastructure matches it.
