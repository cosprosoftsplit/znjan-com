## Is Žnjan Beach Safe?

Yes. Žnjan is one of the safest beaches in Split, with lifeguards on duty during summer, modern facilities, and well-maintained infrastructure. However, like any Adriatic beach, there are a few things to be aware of.

## Sea Urchins

**The #1 safety concern at Croatian beaches.** Sea urchins (morski ježevi in Croatian) are small, spiny creatures that live on rocks and rocky seabeds.

**Where they are:** Found mainly on rocky areas, particularly the **eastern end** of Žnjan. They're less common on the pebbly main beach but can appear near any rocks.

**Prevention:** Wear **water shoes**. This is the single most important piece of beach gear in Croatia. Rubber sandals or aqua shoes protect your feet both on the pebble beach and in the water.

**If you step on one:** The spines can embed in your skin and hurt considerably. Don't try to pull them out — they break easily. Instead:
1. Soak the affected foot in **warm vinegar or warm water** to help dissolve the spines
2. Most small spines will dissolve naturally within a few days
3. See a doctor if the area becomes red, swollen, or infected

## Jellyfish

Jellyfish are **uncommon** in the Split area compared to other Mediterranean destinations, but they do appear occasionally, usually in late summer (August–September).

**Common types:** The moon jellyfish (mostly harmless, mild sting) and occasionally the compass jellyfish (more painful sting).

**What to do if stung:**
1. Rinse with **seawater** (not fresh water)
2. Remove any tentacle fragments with a credit card edge
3. Apply **vinegar** if available
4. Take antihistamine if the reaction is significant
5. Seek medical help for severe reactions or stings to the face/throat

**Tip:** Ask lifeguards about current jellyfish conditions. They monitor the water daily.

## Water Depth & Currents

### Depth
The water at Žnjan's main beach has a **moderate slope** — it reaches waist-depth within a few metres. The **kids' zone** is specifically designed with a very gentle entry.

However, some areas (particularly near the rocky eastern section) **get deep quickly**. Non-swimmers and children should stay in the designated swimming areas.

### Currents
The Adriatic Sea at Žnjan is generally **calm** with minimal currents. This isn't an ocean beach — there are no rip currents or significant wave action. The eastward-facing position of the beach provides protection from the prevailing westerly winds.

On windy days (particularly when the **jugo** blows from the south), the sea can become rougher with larger waves. Lifeguards will advise on conditions.

## Lifeguards

- **On duty:** June to September, covering the main beach and kids' zone
- **Hours:** Typically 9am–7pm during peak season
- **Off-season:** No lifeguards from October to May — swim at your own risk
- **Flags:** Watch for flag signals — red means no swimming, yellow means caution

## Sun Safety

The Croatian Adriatic sun is **intense**, especially from June to August:

- **UV Index:** Reaches 8–10 (very high) in peak summer
- **Sunburn time:** As little as 15 minutes for fair skin without protection
- **Peak hours:** 11am–3pm is when UV is strongest

**Protection:**
- SPF 30–50 sunscreen, reapplied every 2 hours and after swimming
- Wide-brimmed hat and UV sunglasses
- UV-protective swimwear for children
- Seek shade during the midday hours — the promenade has some tree cover

## Pebble Beach Safety

Žnjan's pebble surface is generally smoother than rocky beaches, but:

- **Walking barefoot** can be uncomfortable — water shoes recommended
- **Running on pebbles** is a slip risk, especially when wet
- **Sitting directly on pebbles** is fine with a thick towel or beach mat

## Emergency Information

- **European emergency number:** 112 (police, fire, ambulance)
- **Lifeguard station:** Located at the main beach area
- **Nearest hospital:** KBC Split (University Hospital Split), approximately 15 minutes by car
- **Pharmacies:** Available in the Žnjan neighbourhood and along the route to the city centre

## Quick Safety Checklist

- [ ] Pack water shoes
- [ ] Apply sunscreen before arriving
- [ ] Check with lifeguards about conditions
- [ ] Identify the lifeguard station location
- [ ] Keep children supervised near water
- [ ] Stay hydrated — bring water or buy at the beach
- [ ] Avoid swimming alone, especially off-season
- [ ] Know the emergency number: 112
