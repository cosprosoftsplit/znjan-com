## The Free Stuff

Good news first: **the beach and promenade are completely free.** There's no entrance fee, no access charge, and no minimum spend. You can bring your own towel, lay it on the pebbles, swim all day, and walk the entire 2 km promenade without spending a cent.

Free showers are available along the beach for rinsing off.

## Sunbed & Parasol Prices

If you want comfort, here's what to expect:

| Venue Type | Sunbed + Parasol | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Budget beach area** | €15–20 | Basic sunbed, simple parasol |
| **Mid-range beach club** | €20–35 | Comfortable bed, table service |
| **Premium beach club** (Taboo, Palma) | €35–50+ | Daybed/VIP area, cocktail service |
| **Bring your own** | €0 | Towel on the pebbles — free! |

Most beach clubs operate on a **minimum spend** basis for their premium areas rather than a flat rental fee. So a €35 daybed might mean you need to order at least €35 worth of food/drinks.

## Food & Drink Prices

Typical prices across the pavilion restaurants and beach bars:

| Item | Price Range |
|------|------------|
| **Coffee / Cappuccino** | €2–4 |
| **Soft drink (Coca-Cola)** | €3–5 |
| **Beer (0.5L)** | €4–6 |
| **Cocktail** | €8–14 |
| **Water (0.5L bottle)** | €2–3 |
| **Ice cream (scoop)** | €2–3 |
| **Pizza** | €8–14 |
| **Burger** | €10–15 |
| **Fish / Seafood main** | €15–25 |
| **Pasta** | €12–18 |
| **Salad** | €8–12 |

**How it compares:** Prices are about **20–30% higher** than restaurants in the Split city centre. This is standard for beachfront locations in Croatia.

## Activity Prices

| Activity | Price | Duration |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **SUP rental** | €10–15 | 1 hour |
| **Kayak rental** | €12–18 | 1 hour |
| **Beach volleyball** | Free | Public courts |
| **Cycling (bike rental)** | €8–12 | Full day |
| **Snorkeling gear rental** | €5–10 | Half day |

## Parking Costs

Underground garage and outdoor lots — check with attendants for current rates. Budget approximately **€5–10 per day** for parking, depending on duration and season.

## Sample Day Budgets

### Budget Day (€0–20 per person)
- Bring your own towel, food, water, and snacks from a supermarket
- Swim, walk the promenade, play on the free volleyball courts
- **Total: €0** (or ~€5 for bus tickets + €10 for an ice cream and coffee)

### Mid-Range Day (€30–60 per person)
- Rent a sunbed (€20)
- Coffee in the morning (€3)
- Lunch at Central Beach or GAL Split (€15–20)
- Afternoon beer or cocktail (€5–10)
- **Total: ~€45–55**

### Splash-Out Day (€80–150 per person)
- Premium daybed at Taboo or Palma (€35–50)
- Cocktails (€20–30)
- Seafood lunch (€20–25)
- SUP or kayak rental (€12–15)
- **Total: ~€90–120**

## Money-Saving Tips

1. **Bring food and water** from a supermarket — Konzum and Studenac are the nearest chains
2. **Go on weekdays** — some venues have weekday specials
3. **Skip the sunbed** — a towel on the pebbles works fine (bring water shoes for comfort)
4. **Take the bus** instead of driving — saves parking fees and fuel
5. **Eat lunch early or late** — some restaurants have better value before noon or after 3pm
6. **Bring your own snorkel gear** — cheaper than renting and better quality
7. **Drink water from the fountain** — free refills instead of buying bottles
