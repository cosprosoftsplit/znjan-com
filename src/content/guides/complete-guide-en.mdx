## What is Znjan Beach?

Znjan Beach (pronounced "Zhnyan") is Split's largest beach, stretching over **2 kilometres** along the city's eastern coastline. After a landmark **€45.77 million transformation** (including **€13.94 million in EU funding**) completed in 2025, it has been reborn as the "Miami of Split" — a modern beachfront with 11 new pavilion buildings, an underground parking garage, redesigned promenade, and world-class amenities.

The beach officially reopened on **June 21, 2025** (the first day of summer), and is managed by **Znjan d.o.o.** (director: Marijan Ciprijan) under a 40-year concession from the City of Split. The total concession area covers an enormous **218,322 m²** — 95,176 m² of sea and 123,146 m² of land.

## How to Get to Znjan Beach

### By Bus
The most affordable option. Take **bus line 8 or 15** from Split city centre. The ride takes approximately 15–20 minutes. Get off at the Žnjan stop — you'll see the beach immediately.

### By Car
Follow the coastal road (Šetalište Pape Ivana Pavla II) east from the centre. The new **underground garage has 530 parking spaces**, plus **451 outdoor parking spots**. During peak summer months, arrive before 10am for the best availability.

### By Taxi or Uber
A ride from Diocletian's Palace takes about 10 minutes and costs **€6–9**. Uber and Bolt are both widely available in Split.

### By Bicycle
Split has expanding cycling infrastructure. The promenade along Znjan is flat and well-paved — perfect for cycling. Several rental shops operate near the beach.

## Parking at Znjan Beach

| Parking Type | Spaces | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Underground garage | 530 (2 levels) | Covered, cooler for your car in summer |
| Outdoor lots | 451 | Closer to some beach areas |
| **Total** | **~981** | |

Parking is **€1 per hour** (charges began July 16, 2025). The full 2026 price list is available on [znjan.hr](https://znjan.hr/znjanski-plato/parkiraliste/). Ten spaces in the underground garage are reserved for disabled drivers.

**Tip:** The underground garage fills up fast on weekends from late June through August. Consider arriving early or using public transport.

## Beach Areas

Znjan Beach is divided into several distinct zones:

- **Main Beach** — The central stretch with the finest pebble surface, ideal for families. Lifeguards on duty in summer.
- **Kids' Area** — Shallow water zones with soft entry, playgrounds, and family-friendly facilities.
- **Sports Zone** — Beach volleyball courts, fitness areas, and water sports equipment rental.
- **Promenade** — A redesigned 2km walkway connecting all areas, lined with restaurants, bars, and shops.
- **Rocky Eastern End** — For those who prefer a more natural setting. Popular with snorkelers.

## What's New After the Transformation

The €45.77M investment (designed by architect **Ante Kuzmanić**, built by **Lavčević d.d.**) brought:

- **11 brand-new pavilion buildings** awarded through FINA auction with 10-year leases (generating €2.8M annual revenue)
- **Underground parking garage** (530 spaces, 2 levels) — no more chaotic surface parking
- **Redesigned promenade** stretching 2+ km the full length of the beach
- **~48,000 m² of green space** — ~730 trees/palms and 12,815 native shrubs, making it Split's second-largest park after Marjan
- **Amphitheatre with steel dome** — Open-air venue for concerts, cinema, and events
- **Modern infrastructure** including new water, sewage, electrical, and fibre-optic systems
- **Full accessibility** — Hydraulic sea-access elevator, accessible beach (opened summer 2024), ramps throughout
- **Skate park** (~1,200 m²), **playground** (~600 m²), splash pads, and sports courts
- **Tourist medical clinic** — Operating June–September for beach-related medical needs

## Where to Eat and Drink

- **Stand-Up Paddleboarding (SUP)** — Rental available along the beach
- **Beach Volleyball** — Multiple courts in the sports zone
- **Kayaking** — Explore the coastline from the water

## Best Time to Visit

- **May & October** — Shoulder season. Fewer crowds, pleasant weather, some venues may have limited hours.
- **November–April** — Off-season. The promenade is great for walks, but most beach venues are closed.

**Peak hours** in summer are 11am–4pm. For a more relaxed experience, visit in the early morning or late afternoon.

## Tips for Your Visit

1. **Bring water shoes** — The beach is pebble, not sand
2. **Arrive early** in peak season for parking and the best spots
3. **Use sunscreen** — The Adriatic sun is strong, especially from noon to 3pm
4. **Try the local food** — Skip chain restaurants and enjoy the new pavilion venues
5. **Explore beyond the main beach** — The eastern rocky area is less crowded and great for snorkeling
6. **Download Uber/Bolt** — Taxis can be hard to find at busy times
