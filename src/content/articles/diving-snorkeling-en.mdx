## Snorkeling at Žnjan

Žnjan's clear Adriatic water — often with visibility exceeding 10 metres — makes it one of Split's better spots for casual snorkeling. You don't need a boat or a guided trip; just bring a mask and fins and wade in.

### Best Snorkeling Spots

**Eastern rocky area** — The best snorkeling at Žnjan is along the rocky eastern section of the beach. Here you'll find:
- Underwater rock formations with crevices and overhangs
- Sea urchins (watch your feet — wear water shoes)
- Small fish darting between rocks
- Occasional octopus hiding in crevices
- Sea cucumbers on the rocky bottom

**Along the breakwaters** — The stone structures along the beach create artificial reef habitat where fish congregate.

**Near the shore rocks** — Even in shallow water (1–2 metres), you'll find marine life on and around rocks.

### What You'll See

The Adriatic near Split hosts a variety of marine life:

| Marine Life | Likelihood | Where to Look |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Small fish** (wrasse, blennies, gobies) | Very common | Rocks, crevices |
| **Sea urchins** | Very common | Rocky areas — avoid stepping on them |
| **Sea cucumbers** | Common | Sandy/rocky bottom |
| **Hermit crabs** | Common | Shallow rocky areas |
| **Octopus** | Occasional | Rock crevices, usually morning |
| **Sea bream** | Common | Slightly deeper water (3–5m) |
| **Starfish** | Occasional | Rocky bottom |
| **Jellyfish** | Rare | Open water, late summer |

### Snorkeling Tips

1. **Morning is best** — Calmer water, better visibility, marine life is more active
2. **Wear water shoes** — Essential for entering over rocks and avoiding sea urchins
3. **Don't touch sea urchins** — Their spines break off in skin and hurt considerably
4. **Stay close to shore** — The best marine life is in the first 5–10 metres of water
5. **Bring your own gear** — Rental is available but your own mask fits better

### Gear Rental

- **Snorkel set rental at Žnjan:** €5–10 for a half day
- **Buy a set in Split:** Sporting goods stores sell basic snorkel sets from €15–25
- **Bring from home:** If you snorkel regularly, your own gear is worth packing

## Scuba Diving Near Split

Žnjan itself isn't a scuba diving destination — the water is shallow and the seabed is primarily pebble and rock close to shore. However, Split has several excellent dive sites within easy reach.

### Dive Centres in Split

Several PADI/SSI-certified dive centres operate from Split's harbour area, offering:
- **Discover Scuba** (beginners): €60–80 for a half-day introduction
- **Single fun dive** (certified divers): €40–60
- **Full PADI Open Water course**: €350–450 (3–4 days)
- **Day trip with 2 dives**: €80–120

Most centres include equipment rental in their prices and provide boat transport to dive sites.

### Notable Dive Sites Near Split

| Site | Depth | Highlights | Distance from Split |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Brač Island wrecks** | 15–40m | WWII wrecks, dramatic walls | 30 min by boat |
| **Šolta Island** | 10–30m | Underwater caves, clear water | 25 min by boat |
| **Čiovo reef** | 8–25m | Rich marine life, wall dives | 40 min by boat |
| **Vis Island** | 10–50m | Best visibility, B-17 bomber wreck | Day trip |

### What Certified Divers Will See

The central Adriatic around Split offers:
- **Visibility:** 15–30+ metres (some of the best in the Mediterranean)
- **Water temperature:** 16–26°C depending on depth and season
- **Marine life:** Grouper, moray eels, lobster, nudibranchs, octopus, scorpionfish
- **Wrecks:** Several WWII-era wrecks accessible to recreational divers
- **Caves and walls:** Dramatic underwater topography around the islands

## Best Time for Underwater Activities

| Month | Water Temp | Visibility | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **May–June** | 19–22°C | Excellent | Calm seas, good marine life |
| **July–August** | 25–26°C | Good to excellent | Warm, occasional plankton blooms reduce visibility |
| **September–October** | 21–24°C | Best of the year | Warmest visibility, marine life active |

**September is the sweet spot** — warm water, best visibility, and fewer boats on the water.

## Tips

1. **Snorkeling at Žnjan requires no booking** — just show up with gear
2. **For scuba, book 1–2 days ahead** in peak season (July–August)
3. **Bring an underwater camera** — even a waterproof phone case works for snorkeling photos
4. **Check conditions** — Ask lifeguards about visibility and any jellyfish warnings before snorkeling
5. **Respect marine life** — Don't touch, collect, or disturb underwater creatures
