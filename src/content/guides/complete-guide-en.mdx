## What is Znjan Beach?

Znjan Beach (pronounced "Zhnyan") is Split's largest beach, stretching over **2 kilometres** along the city's eastern coastline. After a landmark **€45.5 million transformation** completed in 2025, it has been reborn as the "Miami of Split" — a modern beachfront with 11 new pavilion buildings, an underground parking garage, redesigned promenade, and world-class amenities.

The beach officially reopened on **June 21, 2025**, and is managed by **Znjan d.o.o.** under a 40-year concession from the City of Split.

## How to Get to Znjan Beach

### By Bus
The most affordable option. Take **bus line 8 or 15** from Split city centre. The ride takes approximately 15–20 minutes. Get off at the Žnjan stop — you'll see the beach immediately.

### By Car
Follow the coastal road (Šetalište Pape Ivana Pavla II) east from the centre. The new **underground garage has 530 parking spaces**, plus **451 outdoor parking spots**. During peak summer months, arrive before 10am for the best availability.

### By Taxi or Uber
A ride from Diocletian's Palace takes about 10 minutes and costs **€6–9**. Uber and Bolt are both widely available in Split.

### By Bicycle
Split has expanding cycling infrastructure. The promenade along Znjan is flat and well-paved — perfect for cycling. Several rental shops operate near the beach.

## Parking at Znjan Beach

| Parking Type | Spaces | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Underground garage | 530 | Covered, cooler for your car in summer |
| Outdoor lots | 451 | Closer to some beach areas |

**Tip:** The underground garage fills up fast on weekends from late June through August. Consider arriving early or using public transport.

## Beach Areas

Znjan Beach is divided into several distinct zones:

- **Main Beach** — The central stretch with the finest pebble surface, ideal for families. Lifeguards on duty in summer.
- **Kids' Area** — Shallow water zones with soft entry, playgrounds, and family-friendly facilities.
- **Sports Zone** — Beach volleyball courts, fitness areas, and water sports equipment rental.
- **Promenade** — A redesigned 2km walkway connecting all areas, lined with restaurants, bars, and shops.
- **Rocky Eastern End** — For those who prefer a more natural setting. Popular with snorkelers.

## What's New After the Transformation

The €45.5M investment brought:

- **11 brand-new pavilion buildings** awarded through FINA auction with 10-year leases
- **Underground parking garage** (530 spaces) — no more chaotic surface parking
- **Redesigned promenade** stretching the full length of the beach
- **Modern infrastructure** including new water, sewage, and electrical systems
- **Improved accessibility** with ramps and accessible pathways
- **Landscaped green areas** and pedestrian zones

## Where to Eat and Drink

The new pavilion buildings house some of Split's most exciting venues:

- **Palma Beach Club** — Premium beach club with cocktails, lounges, and sea views
- **Taboo Beach Club** — Upscale seaside venue with DJ sets and VIP areas
- **Mistral Beach Club** — The area's long-standing favourite at Radisson Blu Resort
- **Casa Sol** — Mediterranean restaurant with Italian influences
- **Central Beach** — All-day dining right on the beachfront
- **MIMI Italian Clubino** — Italian cuisine and fine dining by F Group

## Activities and Water Sports

There's no shortage of things to do:

- **Stand-Up Paddleboarding (SUP)** — Rental available along the beach
- **Beach Volleyball** — Multiple courts in the sports zone
- **Kayaking** — Explore the coastline from the water
- **Cycling & Running** — The promenade is perfect for both
- **Snorkeling** — Best at the rocky eastern end

## Best Time to Visit

- **June–September** — Full season. All venues open, lifeguards on duty, water warm enough for swimming (22–26°C).
- **May & October** — Shoulder season. Fewer crowds, pleasant weather, some venues may have limited hours.
- **November–April** — Off-season. The promenade is great for walks, but most beach venues are closed.

**Peak hours** in summer are 11am–4pm. For a more relaxed experience, visit in the early morning or late afternoon.

## Tips for Your Visit

1. **Bring water shoes** — The beach is pebble, not sand
2. **Arrive early** in peak season for parking and the best spots
3. **Use sunscreen** — The Adriatic sun is strong, especially from noon to 3pm
4. **Try the local food** — Skip chain restaurants and enjoy the new pavilion venues
5. **Explore beyond the main beach** — The eastern rocky area is less crowded and great for snorkeling
6. **Download Uber/Bolt** — Taxis can be hard to find at busy times
