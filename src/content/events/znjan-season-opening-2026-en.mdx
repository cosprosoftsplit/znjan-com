## Welcome to the Znjan Beach Season Opening 2026

Join us on the longest day of the year as Znjan Beach kicks off another unforgettable summer season. This marks the second full season since the completion of the landmark €45.5 million renovation that transformed Znjan into one of the finest urban beaches on the Adriatic coast.

The celebration begins in the early afternoon with **family-friendly activities** across the beach, including sandcastle competitions, face painting, and games for children of all ages. Local and regional **food vendors** will line the promenade, offering everything from freshly grilled seafood to traditional Dalmatian delicacies and refreshing summer cocktails.

As the afternoon turns to evening, the **Main Stage** comes alive with performances from popular Croatian bands and guest artists, filling the warm summer air with music that will have everyone dancing on the sand.

The grand finale is a **breathtaking fireworks display at sunset**, lighting up the sky over the Adriatic as day gives way to a magical summer night. Admission is completely free — everyone is welcome to be part of this celebration.
