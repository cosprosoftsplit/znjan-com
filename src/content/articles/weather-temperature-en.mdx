## Best Months for Swimming

**Peak swimming season: June to September**

The water temperature stays between **22–26°C** during these months — warm enough for extended swimming without a wetsuit. August is the warmest month on average.

**September is the sweet spot.** The sea retains summer heat (24°C average) while crowds drop significantly after European school holidays end. Air temperatures are still pleasant at 25°C, and you'll have far more space on the beach.

**May and October** are shoulder months. The water is 19–21°C — refreshing rather than warm. Locals swim from mid-May, but most tourists find it a bit cool.

## Best Time to Visit Overall

| Priority | Best Month(s) | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| **Best weather + warm water** | July–August | Peak summer, 25–26°C water, 29°C air |
| **Best balance (fewer crowds)** | June, September | Warm enough for swimming, significantly fewer tourists |
| **Best for budget** | May, October | Lower accommodation prices, restaurants less busy |
| **Best for walking/cycling** | April–May, October | Comfortable temperatures without intense heat |
| **Avoid for beach** | November–March | Cool water, many venues closed |

## What to Expect by Season

### Summer (June–August)
Expect hot, sunny days with highs of 26–30°C and minimal rain. The sea is warm and inviting. Beach clubs, restaurants, and all facilities are fully operational. Lifeguards are on duty. The downside: July and August bring peak crowds and highest prices.

### Shoulder Season (May, September–October)
Pleasant temperatures for outdoor activities. September still offers great swimming. May mornings can be fresh but afternoons are warm. Some beach venues may have limited hours. Accommodation is cheaper and the beach is quieter.

### Winter (November–April)
The beach and promenade are open year-round, and the promenade is lovely for walks even in winter. However, the sea is too cold for most swimmers (14–18°C), and most pavilion restaurants are closed. You'll have the place nearly to yourself.

## Wind & Sea Conditions

Split's coastline is affected by two main winds:

- **Maestral** (northwesterly) — The summer afternoon breeze. Welcome relief from the heat, typically blowing from early afternoon until evening. It creates small waves but nothing dangerous.
- **Jugo** (southeasterly) — A warm, humid wind that can bring clouds and rougher seas. More common in autumn and spring. Swimming is still possible but the sea may be less clear.

Žnjan's east-facing position provides some natural protection from the prevailing westerly winds, making it calmer than west-facing beaches like Kasjuni on windy days.

## UV Index

The UV index in Split reaches **8–10** (very high) during June–August. Sunburn can occur in as little as 15–20 minutes without protection.

**Sun safety tips:**
- Apply **SPF 30–50** sunscreen, reapply every 2 hours and after swimming
- Seek shade between **12pm and 3pm** when UV is strongest
- Wear a **hat and sunglasses**
- Children should wear **UV-protective swimwear**
