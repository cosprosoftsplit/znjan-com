## Overview

Žnjan Beach is one of the **most accessible beaches in Split**, thanks to the €45.77M renovation that was designed with universal access in mind. In fact, the **accessible beach was the first part of the entire complex to open** — it welcomed visitors during **summer 2024**, a full year before the main beach's grand opening on June 21, 2025. This early opening reflects how central accessibility was to the project's design.

## Promenade Accessibility

The 2+ km **promenade is fully wheelchair accessible**:

- **Wide, flat surface** — Smooth paving throughout, wide enough for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, and strollers side by side
- **No steps on the main promenade** — Continuous flat path the entire length
- **Gentle gradients** — Where level changes exist, ramps are provided
- **Tactile paving** — In key areas for visitors with visual impairments
- **Rest areas** — Benches at regular intervals along the route
- **Shade** — Some sections have tree cover for rest stops out of the sun

The promenade alone makes Žnjan worth visiting for anyone with mobility challenges — it's one of the finest accessible coastal walks in Croatia.

## Beach Access

### Getting to the Water

The main challenge at any pebble beach is crossing the pebbles to reach the sea. Žnjan addresses this with:

- **Accessible ramps** leading from the promenade level down to beach level at multiple points
- **Hydraulic sea-access elevator** — A dedicated **hydraulic elevator** assists swimmers with mobility challenges into and out of the water. This is located at the designated accessible swimming zone.
- **Floating safety barriers** — The accessible swimming area is enclosed with floating barriers for added safety
- **Trained assistants** — Lifeguards and assistants are on hand during summer season to help with sea entry
- **Adapted beach areas** with level access closer to the waterline

### The Accessible Beach Zone

The dedicated accessible beach features a comprehensive set of facilities:

- **Adapted WC and changing cabin** — Purpose-built accessible toilet and changing facilities at the beach zone
- **Shower facilities** — Accessible showers near the water
- **Beach umbrellas** — Provided at the accessible zone
- **Beach wheelchair** — Adapted beach wheelchairs with wide wheels available (check with lifeguards)
- **Beach mats** — Rollable access mats deployed to provide a stable path to the water
- **The promenade itself** offers excellent sea views and access to all restaurants without needing to go onto the pebbles

## Facilities

### Accessible Toilets

Adapted public toilets are available along the promenade. They feature:
- Wide doors for wheelchair access
- Grab rails
- Lower fixtures
- Located at several points along the 2 km route

### Accessible Showers

Some of the public shower points along the beach are designed to be accessible for wheelchair users.

### Parking

The **underground parking garage** (530 spaces, 2 levels) has **10 spaces reserved** for disabled drivers, positioned near the elevators and connected to the beach by an accessible path. The outdoor parking areas (451 spaces) also have accessible spots. From the garage, elevator access brings you to promenade level. Parking is **€1 per hour** (charges began July 16, 2025).

### Restaurants & Beach Clubs

Most of the new **pavilion buildings** (11 in total) were designed with accessibility in mind:
- Step-free or ramped access to most venues
- Accessible seating areas
- Accessible toilets in larger venues

However, some smaller venues may have limited accessibility. Check in advance for specific requirements.

## Tips for Visitors with Disabilities

1. **Arrive via the underground garage** — It has the best accessible parking and elevator access to the promenade
2. **Contact lifeguards** about sea entry assistance — Available during summer season
3. **The promenade is the star** — Even if getting onto the pebbles is challenging, the promenade offers full access to the Žnjan experience (views, restaurants, atmosphere)
4. **Visit in the morning** — Fewer crowds mean easier navigation and more space
5. **Bring sun protection** — Shade is limited on the beach itself, though the promenade has some tree cover
6. **Bus accessibility** — Split city buses (lines 8 and 15 to Žnjan) have low-floor vehicles, though availability varies

## Accessibility for Other Needs

### Visual Impairments
- Tactile paving is present in key areas
- The flat, obstacle-free promenade is relatively easy to navigate
- Beach clubs and restaurants are staffed and can assist

### Hearing Impairments
- Lifeguard flags (visual signals) are used for water safety: red = no swimming, yellow = caution, green = safe
- Most restaurants have menus you can read (multilingual)

### Sensory Sensitivities
- **Quieter times:** Early morning (before 10am) or September when crowds are lower
- **Quieter zones:** Eastern end of the beach, away from beach clubs and music
- The open-air environment and sea sounds can be calming, but beach clubs play music during the day in summer

### Travelling with Mobility Equipment
- **Wheelchair rental in Split:** Medical supply shops in the city can arrange short-term rental
- **Mobility scooter:** The promenade is suitable for mobility scooters — wide and flat
- **Walking frames/sticks:** The paved promenade surface is stable and suitable
