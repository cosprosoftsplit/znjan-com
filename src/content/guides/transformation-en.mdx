## The Biggest Beach Transformation in Croatia's History

On **Saturday, June 21, 2025** — the first day of summer — Split officially unveiled a completely reborn Žnjan Beach. The culmination of a **€45.77 million investment** (including **€13.94 million in EU funding** from the European Regional Development Fund), it represents the **largest coastal development in Split in 45 years** and has transformed a neglected coastline into a world-class beachfront that locals now proudly call the "Miami of Split."

Mayor **Tomislav Šuta** declared at the opening ceremony: *"We have gained a location that represents more than just a beach. It's a gathering place for citizens to enjoy various events, cultural activities, and sports programs vital to Split."*

The grand opening was celebrated with performances by **TBF**, **Ante Gelo with orchestra**, **Zorica Kondža**, **Albina**, **Goran Karan**, and **Tajči**, along with contemporary dance, acrobatics, a drone light show, and fireworks — hosted by **Iva Šulentić** and **Tarik Filipović**.

## What Was Žnjan Like Before?

For decades, Žnjan Beach was Split's biggest missed opportunity. Despite being the city's longest beach at over 2 kilometres, it suffered from:

- **Chaotic parking** — Cars parked haphazardly on dirt lots, creating dust and congestion
- **Crumbling infrastructure** — Outdated water, sewage, and electrical systems
- **Informal food stalls** — A mix of temporary stands with inconsistent quality
- **No proper promenade** — Pedestrians competed with cars and cyclists on narrow paths
- **Limited accessibility** — No wheelchair ramps, no proper pathways
- **Neglected greenery** — Sparse vegetation and bare concrete

Despite these problems, Split residents loved Žnjan for its long shoreline, shallow-entry areas for kids, and eastward-facing position that caught the morning sun. It was always packed in summer — just not comfortable.

## The Vision: Žnjanski Plato

The idea of transforming Žnjan dates back to **1998**, but it took decades to gather the political will and funding. In **2017**, an architectural competition was held, and **architect Ante Kuzmanić** was selected in February 2018 with a design that prioritised public space, green infrastructure, and Mediterranean identity.

The City of Split, working through **Žnjan d.o.o.** (a city-owned company granted a **40-year concession** from the Croatian government in November 2022), turned the vision into reality. The total concession area covers an enormous **218,322 m²** — 95,176 m² of sea and 123,146 m² of land.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Public-first** — All beaches, promenades, and public areas remain free and accessible
2. **Sustainable** — Native Mediterranean plantings, modern drainage, energy-efficient infrastructure
3. **Mixed-use** — Commercial pavilions alongside public amenities
4. **Accessible** — Full wheelchair and stroller access throughout
5. **Year-round** — Designed for summer shade and winter sunlight, with full landscaping potential expected within 10 years

## What Changed: The Before & After

### Infrastructure

**Before:** Crumbling pipes, frequent sewage issues, unreliable electricity for vendors.
**After:** Completely new underground infrastructure — water mains, sewage system, electrical grid, and fibre-optic connectivity. Everything is built to modern EU standards.

### Parking

**Before:** Chaotic dirt lots, cars parked on grass, dust clouds in summer.
**After:** A **530-space two-level underground garage** keeps cars out of sight, plus **451 organised outdoor spots**. Parking charges began **July 16, 2025** at **€1 per hour**. The surface is now pedestrian-friendly with proper walkways.

### The Promenade

**Before:** A narrow, uneven path shared by pedestrians, cyclists, and occasionally cars.
**After:** A **2+ kilometre redesigned promenade** with separate lanes for pedestrians and cyclists, lined with native plantings, benches, and lighting. It connects all beach zones seamlessly.

### Dining and Nightlife

**Before:** Informal stands, a few beach bars of varying quality.
**After:** **11 brand-new pavilion buildings** housing premium beach clubs, restaurants, and bars — including Palma Beach Club, Taboo Beach Club, Casa Sol, Central Beach, MIMI Italian Clubino, and GAL Split. All were awarded through transparent FINA auctions with 10-year lease terms.

### Green Spaces

**Before:** Bare concrete and sparse vegetation.
**After:** **48,000 m² of landscaped greenery** — making Žnjan Split's second-largest green area after Marjan Park. The planting includes **730 trees and palms** and over **12,800 native shrubs**.

### The Amphitheatre

One of the most exciting additions: an **open-air amphitheatre with a distinctive steel dome** (kupola), which became a visual landmark of the new Žnjan. Assembly of the dome began in late 2024 and was completed in early 2025. The amphitheatre is designed for concerts, festivals, cinema screenings, and community events, taking advantage of the natural sea-view backdrop and summer evening breezes. The entire Žnjan project won a **professional award (nagrada struke)** at the annual Assembly of Civil Engineers.

### Accessibility

**Before:** No wheelchair access, no accessible toilets, rocky and uneven terrain.
**After:** Full **wheelchair-accessible paths and ramps** from the promenade to the beach. A **hydraulic sea-access elevator** for swimmers with mobility challenges. Accessible toilets, showers, changing cabins, beach umbrellas, and trained assistants on hand. The accessible beach was actually the first part to open — it welcomed visitors during **summer 2024**, a full year before the main beach opened.

### Kids' Facilities

**Before:** A few worn-out playground structures.
**After:** Modern playgrounds, splash areas, and a dedicated kids' beach zone with shallow, calm water. Bouncy castles and trampolines operate in summer season.

## The New Miami of Split

The transformation quickly earned Žnjan the nickname "**Miami of Split**" — not for flash or excess, but for the quality of the beachfront experience:

- **Modern architecture** blending Mediterranean and contemporary design
- **Palm-lined promenade** reminiscent of oceanfront walkways
- **Premium beach clubs** with loungers, cocktails, and DJ sets
- **Active lifestyle amenities** — volleyball courts, cycling paths, running routes
- **Evening atmosphere** — illuminated promenade, amphitheatre events, beachfront dining

The comparison is flattering but Žnjan has its own character. It's distinctly Croatian — the pebble beach, the crystal-clear Adriatic, the smell of grilled fish from the pavilion restaurants, and the relaxed Mediterranean pace.

## How the Pavilion Buildings Work

The 11 pavilion buildings are the commercial heart of the new Žnjan. Here's how they were allocated:

1. **FINA auction process** — Transparent public bidding ensured fair market rates
2. **10-year lease terms** — Long enough for operators to invest in quality fitouts
3. **Design guidelines** — All buildings follow an architectural master plan for visual consistency
4. **Public benefit requirements** — Operators must maintain public access to surrounding areas

Current confirmed operators include **Palma Beach Club**, **Taboo Beach Club**, **Mistral Beach Club** (at Radisson Blu), **Casa Sol**, **Central Beach**, **MIMI Italian Clubino** (F Group), and **GAL Split**, with more opening as pavilions are completed.

## What's Still Coming

While the beach is fully operational, some elements continue to develop:

- **Aquapark** — A public tender has been issued for an aquapark concession within the beach complex
- **Diving & windsurfing clubs** — Separate concession tenders for a diving club and windsurfing club
- **Tourist medical clinic** — A 36.57 m² medical facility will operate June–September
- **Landscaping maturation** — The 730 newly planted trees will grow to full canopy over the coming years
- **Cultural programming** — The amphitheatre's event calendar expands each season
- **Mövenpick Hotel Žnjan** — Croatia's first Mövenpick hotel opens in 2026, adding a rooftop infinity pool and 156 rooms overlooking the beach

## Visiting the New Žnjan

The best way to experience the transformation is to visit. The beach is open year-round (venues are seasonal, June–September), and the promenade is perfect for walking or cycling any time.

**Getting there:** Bus lines **8 and 15** from Split centre, or 10 minutes by car/taxi.

**Parking:** Underground garage (530 spaces) + outdoor lots (451 spaces). **€1 per hour** since July 2025.

**Cost:** The beach and promenade are completely **free**. Sunbed rental at beach clubs ranges from €20–50 depending on the venue.

## The Impact

The Žnjan transformation is more than a beach renovation — it's a statement about Split's future as a year-round Mediterranean destination. It adds:

- **Green infrastructure** to a city that needed it
- **Quality hospitality venues** that compete with Dubrovnik and Hvar
- **Accessible public space** that serves residents and visitors equally
- **Economic activity** through tourism, hospitality jobs, and property value increases

Žnjan is proof that public investment in coastal infrastructure pays off — and that the "Miami of Split" is more than just a nickname.
