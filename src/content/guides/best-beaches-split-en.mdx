## Split's Best Beaches at a Glance

Split sits on a peninsula with beaches on almost every side — from busy city beaches to hidden rocky coves under the Marjan forest. Here's our complete ranking for 2026, with honest assessments of who each beach is best for.

| Beach | Type | Best For | Distance from Old Town | Our Rating |
|-------|------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Žnjan** | Pebble | Families, sports, nightlife | 4 km (15 min by bus) | 9/10 |
| **Bačvice** | Sand | Convenience, young children | 500 m (7 min walk) | 7/10 |
| **Kasjuni** | Pebble | Couples, tranquillity | 3 km (20 min walk) | 8/10 |
| **Bene** | Pebble/Concrete | Nature lovers, swimmers | 3.5 km (25 min walk) | 7/10 |
| **Kaštelet** | Rocky | Locals, sunbathing | 2 km (15 min walk) | 6/10 |
| **Ovčice** | Pebble | Families, calm water | 1 km (12 min walk) | 7/10 |
| **Trstenik** | Pebble | Locals, laid-back vibe | 2.5 km (12 min by bus) | 6/10 |
| **Jezinac** | Rocky | Snorkeling, adventure | 2.5 km (18 min walk) | 7/10 |

## 1. Žnjan Beach — The Best Overall

**Type:** Pebble | **Length:** 2+ km | **Bus:** Lines 8, 15

After the **€45.77 million transformation** completed in 2025, Žnjan is now Split's undisputed top beach. It has everything:

- **11 new pavilion restaurants and beach clubs** (Palma, Taboo, Casa Sol, Central Beach, MIMI, GAL Split)
- **Underground parking** for 530 cars + 451 outdoor spots
- **Kids' zone** with shallow water, playgrounds, and bouncy castles
- **Sports zone** with volleyball courts and water sports rental
- **2 km promenade** for cycling and running
- **Open-air amphitheatre** for concerts and events
- **Full accessibility** with ramps, lifts, and accessible toilets

**Best for:** Families, sports enthusiasts, foodies, anyone wanting a full-day beach experience.

**Drawback:** It's Split's most popular beach — arrive early in peak season. The pebble surface requires water shoes.

## 2. Bačvice Beach — The Sandy Classic

**Type:** Sand | **Length:** ~300 m | **Walk:** 7 min from Old Town

Split's most famous beach, and the **only sandy beach** in the city. Bačvice is synonymous with *picigin* — the traditional Split ball game played in shallow water. Its location just south of the old town makes it the most convenient beach for tourists.

**Facilities:** Showers, toilets, lifeguards, several cafes and bars (including Žbirac), volleyball courts.

**Best for:** Tourists staying in the Old Town, very young children (soft sand, shallow water), picigin players.

**Drawback:** Extremely crowded in summer. The sand gets packed shoulder-to-shoulder by noon. Limited parking. Water can get murky when busy.

## 3. Kasjuni Beach — The Scenic Escape

**Type:** Fine pebble | **Length:** ~200 m | **Walk:** 20 min from Old Town

Tucked beneath **Marjan Hill** on Split's western tip, Kasjuni is arguably the most beautiful beach in the city. The pine-forested hillside provides natural shade, and the water is crystal clear.

**Facilities:** One beach bar, sunbed rental, parking lot above (limited). No lifeguards.

**Best for:** Couples, snorkelers, anyone wanting a more relaxed and scenic setting.

**Drawback:** Limited facilities compared to Žnjan or Bačvice. Gets crowded on weekends. The walk down from the road is steep. Limited parking fills early.

## 4. Bene Beach — The Nature Lover's Choice

**Type:** Pebble & concrete | **Length:** ~150 m | **Walk:** 25 min from Old Town

On the **Marjan peninsula**, Bene is set within a sports-recreation area surrounded by pine forest. The water is exceptionally clear, and there's a swimming pool complex nearby.

**Facilities:** Café, showers, changing rooms, tennis courts, swimming pool. Small parking area.

**Best for:** Nature lovers, swimmers, those combining a Marjan hike with a beach visit.

**Drawback:** Mostly concrete and rocky entry. Not great for small children. Relatively far from the city centre.

## 5. Ovčice Beach — The Quiet Family Option

**Type:** Pebble | **Length:** ~200 m | **Walk:** 12 min from Old Town

Just east of Bačvice, Ovčice often gets overlooked by tourists heading to its famous neighbour. That's a good thing — it's quieter, has calm shallow water, and several family-friendly cafes.

**Facilities:** Showers, toilets, cafes, playground nearby.

**Best for:** Families with children who want less chaos than Bačvice, but similar convenience.

**Drawback:** Smaller than other beaches. Can still get busy on peak weekends.

## 6. Jezinac Beach — The Snorkeler's Spot

**Type:** Rocky/Pebble | **Length:** ~100 m | **Walk:** 18 min from Old Town

A small rocky cove on the south side of Marjan, Jezinac offers some of the **best snorkeling** accessible from Split. The rocks create a natural harbour with clear water and visible marine life.

**Facilities:** Minimal — one beach bar. Bring your own supplies.

**Best for:** Snorkelers, adventure seekers, people who prefer rocky natural beaches.

**Drawback:** Very rocky entry (water shoes essential). No sandy areas. Limited shade.

## 7. Trstenik Beach — The Local's Secret

**Type:** Pebble | **Length:** ~250 m | **Bus:** Line 8

East of the city centre, between Bačvice and Žnjan, Trstenik is a neighbourhood beach used mainly by locals. It has a relaxed, residential feel with a few cafes and a small park.

**Facilities:** Showers, cafes, playground.

**Best for:** Locals, visitors staying in the eastern part of Split, anyone wanting an authentic neighbourhood beach.

**Drawback:** No major attractions or facilities. The beach itself is unremarkable compared to Žnjan or Kasjuni.

## 8. Kaštelet Beach — The Sunbather's Perch

**Type:** Rocky/Concrete | **Length:** ~200 m | **Walk:** 15 min from Old Town

A series of rocky platforms and small pebbly coves between Bačvice and Marjan. Popular with locals for flat-rock sunbathing.

**Facilities:** A couple of beach bars.

**Best for:** Sunbathers, locals who know the flat-rock spots, cliff-jumping enthusiasts.

**Drawback:** Rocky and uneven. Not for families with small children. Limited facilities.

## How to Choose Your Beach

**If you have one day in Split:** Go to **Žnjan** for the full experience — it has everything in one place.

**If you're staying near the Old Town:** Start with **Bačvice** for convenience, then bus to **Žnjan** for a full day.

**If you want peace and quiet:** Head to **Kasjuni** early morning.

**If you love snorkeling:** Take the walk to **Jezinac**.

**If you have kids under 5:** **Bačvice** (sand) or **Žnjan Kids' Area** (pebble but excellent facilities).

Split's coastline has a beach for everyone. But if we had to pick just one, the €45.77M transformation makes **Žnjan** the clear winner for 2026.
